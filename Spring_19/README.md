# Attention Models Fall 2019
Findings and Works in the lab for attention related models.

Keep here updated.

Tasks:
- ~~Read papers related to attention~~
- Implement attention (Task Suspended)
    - ~~Imitate tutorials~~
    - Look for the data they use
    - Adapt it to current work
- ~~Back to the Future~~
    - ~~Implement LR and LSTM on IMDB~~
    - ~~Make an Analysis~~
    - ~~Implement MNB~~
- ~~Review Decision Trees~~ 
    - ~~Understand feature_importances_~~
- Inquire coefficients with neutral values
    - ~~Use softmax~~
    - Conclude best weights for decisions
    - Try different ngrams
- Train a Feed-Forward Neural Net
    - Use basic hidden layers and softmax
