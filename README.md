Findings and Works in the lab.

The edu folder contains the most recent work. 
- Models folder under it contains different models I tested.
- active_learning has the EDU labeling parts of the project. 
- EDUS Untouched is there to keep data "untouched."
- Results have the report and some screenshots that have been taken along the way.

aclImdb is the IMDB data for personal training.

Handbook is interesting things I found out of the lab.
