ka great movie in every sense . p
a good plot idea is handled very badly . n
the acting is awful . n
he was excellent in in the bedroom , z
but here he is terrible . n
will be disappointed . n
awful acting n
there was a few funny part . p
`` hmm ... ..that movie had a few funny part p
pretty ridiculous plot n
to be a cooky funny guy . z
it right.my advice would be to avoid this flick . n
forever forgettable . n
that is `` the pagemaster '' .i found this out z
the animation is amazing , p
there are a few scene gem nestled inside this pile of crap n
the whole thing is weak and pointless n
all the acting done in the first season has been really amazing . p
the minis do the best acting job p
all in all this is the best show i have ever watched p
dull n
and back-eakingly boring n
`` the projected man '' is 77 solid minute of nothing n
dull as dishwater . n
dull as doorknob dust . n
dull as ethan hawke - n
we are talking really dull here n
in respect to our dull cousin from across the puddle n
this was a very good action film with some great set piece . p
who manages to maintain some beautiful theme throughout the film p
nicola cazal\u00e9 is a superb actor p
this film is just plain horrible . n
poor editing n
horrible sound mixing n
but dorothy stratten is not the worst actress in this film . p
even bogdanovich 's kid are awful n
this movie is seriously horrible . n
it was great and aesthetically very interesting . p
this show is like a bad pie n
because these ingredient are the best , p
unfortunately for this show n
gundam wing is an amazing show p
to combat the alliance control and the even greater threat z
is probably the most enjoyable gundam series to watch in my opinion . p
how you look at it this is truly one of the most unique and enjoyable gundam series out there , p
the show sport some amazing animation and superb action , p
that should not be missed.a perfect 10/10 ! p
is a bad loser z
to do anything.the terrific shelley winter play the part of lola manner and she is great as always. p
dan duryea is terrific at the part of waco johnnie dean.charle drake is illiant as lola 's cowardly boyfriend steve miller. p
also wyatt earp and bat masterson are seen in the movie , z
since this is a western.it is great to watch this survival game p
the 'twist ' are all pretty predictable , n
but then become utterly banal.not horrible p
kind of boring n
which went to an extent where anil kapoor envisages z
some of the couple like anil kapoor-juhi and sohail khan- z
and please nikhilji avoid putting such superfluous scene in a movie n
that there was not any perfect synchronization between the story of different couple . n
where the director knows the perfect art of threading the different unrelated sequence p
to form a perfect blended storyline.somewhere p
and 28 is considered a bad number in numerology . z
please avoid watching this movie at any cost . n
which serves to set you up for the disappointing n
and stupefying ending.it would not be so remarkably bad n
the only message z
it really lacks n
do not waste your time watching this ! n
i wasted precious time n
to warn other not to waste their time n
i would have to say not bad p
after that it gets annoying . n
the bad audio n
the bad video n
that were funnier and more thrilling than snake on a plane.hell , z
as superior to snake in both laugh and thrills.the sad truth is that this is not even close to the mother of all unintentionally intentional funny snake movie : n
his final scene alone represents everything soap tried and failed to do as a `` so-ludicrous-it is-fun '' movie.in the end , n
that studio execs and fanboy make the worst collaborator possible . n
it is one the best movie i have ever seen in my life ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! p
in which the film has aged poorly is the mere idea n
mid-1980s audience found this film charming and funny . p
a fascinating piece of gothic melodrama p
he alters his editing tactic in a fascinating way . p
and so it is prone to become dull and monotonous at time . n
the acting performance are greatly exaggerated for extra effect n
only to find their only doorway replaced with a wall of solid stone . z
that their supply of oxygen was exhausted surprisingly quickly . z
because those `` perfect ! z
best-ever ! p
( unfortunately not too many person will have any chance z
it is no use and no fun , n
this movie was horrible n
it was so bad i registered with imdb n
( bad ) n
the title is great ... p
sadly , z
you will not see any of that.just a bunch of bad actor , n
though it is not exactly the best work pixar has done.a bug 's life : n
and you loved to watch him being tortured ! z
background music and the editing in general was so bad n
unfortunately for all involved , z
like an bad and old video game.and finally , z
after creating the rule of engagement `` the darkwolf kills anyone z
they are not even funny-kind of bad movie n
the effect were horrible , n
with each one of them telling his or her greatest fear . z
and murdered by their greatest innermost fear.yesterday z
the group gave up watching this messy and boring amateurish piece of crap , n
i decided to watch the rest of this flick to see how bad it could be n
the confused story has an awful cinematography and camera work n
that is probably studying to be actor and actress and in the end this film seems to be a bad project of cinema school . n
the terrible and pretentious screenplay shows a ridiculous twist in the end , n
actually a complete mess n
`` viagem para a morte '' z
he is arriving to great acclaim as his novel z
that parallels an infamous trial is a best seller . z
if he is the killer or not.okay thriller is much too leisurely to be fully enjoyed . n
that this film was rarely seen on tv z
this film is awful in every department . n
well the only thing funny is the ability n
you wasted your time on such dribble . n
and i blame myself for not walking out a lot earlier . n
is a poor tv movie n
it is that bad n
... probably not enough bad word n
it did not look particularly great . n
i would want to waste my time with the blue version of this movie , p
to see this awful pointless piece of pathetic excuse of a film ! im n
without hunting the fact out but is dafoe married or seeing the awful actress in this film in real life , n
first you have the glossy mgm production with big name and great music . p
these poor person have to work in , z
this film does a great job p
it was a great , p
i find the actor work quite weak as well . n
but in this picture he lacks any charm . n
and is being sold in the uk for 40 % of the recommended price z
oh man is this movie bad . n
he tries getting out of the contract and horrible z
painfully unfunny gag ensue . n
burt 's wig was not bad in this film . p
his worst `` wig day '' was in `` smokey and the bandit 2 '' . n
this movie is the worst reynold car movie n
are great z
funny film . p
who is a great actor p
this is not one of those fun movie n
it is lousy n
even the outtake at the end were tiresome and boring n
and worst of all n
unfunny . n
that i partook in watching one of the most ridiculous film id n
im sure the original acting as poor z
even in a bad way z
it was a fun watch . p
it turned out to be a very very bad film , n
and i would not recommend this thing unless one is into bad directorial exploitation film , n
and did not completely fall into the predictable stuff one expected at the outset . p
it is still overall a bad movie , n
but as bad movie go , n
it is a shade more intelligent than the really horrible tripe like mesa of lost woman and robot monster . p
but it is also very funny and enjoyable . p
a great place z
because it will ing back wonderful memory for you and for your kid . p
goodnight mister tom is so beautifully filmed and beautifully realised . p
amazing ! p
10/10 bethany cox p
what a waste of time , n
why waste almost a third of the movie on these sequence . n
then more wasted time showing the reunion with his wife . n
hackman is great as usual , p
the soundtrack is beautiful p
this is another fantasy favorite from ralph bakshi ; p
it is one of the best animated fantasy movie ever made p
and an awesome collaboration between two great mind - ralph bakshi and frank frazetta . p
lindsey lohan is a great actress p
( and a bad singer n
fun fun fun.4/10 . n
`` okul-d @ bbe '' are good example for the awful horror turkish films.but n
also the special feature are colorful and not cheap . p
but the script is not totally perfect n
( 7/10 ) p
with a script so bad , n
that was funny.without one jump under his starry belt , z
which would surely kill a lesser bad comedian z
and ( unfortunately ) gives us three tale to prove why.the first story involves a young couple in a car accident z
it leads up to two totally predictable twist . n
predictable but enjoyable.the second involves a man on the run p
badly done and extremely slow . n
it involves a beautiful z
it has beautiful set design p
predictable and not even remotely scary.it end very stupidly.all in all , n
this was a great movie with a good story . p
all loved this movie , p
the music was also fantastic . p
if view was fun.i think z
it is not a bad yarn , z
and a great deal of the film is shot on location . z
he allows this terrible actress to whimper and simper through the film n
it was fun to see the name of cyril swern as sound recordist on the film , p
worse than lesley anne down in fact ! n
which were surprisingly authentic , p
the best of the best , z
but even the best can not go on forever , n
anderson has delivered an action film with a message p
i rate this one 7/10 . p
disappointing film . n
performance of actor is weak . n
the story is also weak . n
battle sequence are awful . n
the history of kazakh person was told very poorly . n
rustam iagimbekov disappointed me . n
my friend and i rented this for `` bad movie night '' with high hope , z
it also has some great line p
with at least 3 or 4 pointless z
boring chase scene making up the middle third of the plot . n
the scene inside the pri complex are especially bad . n
if you are going to make a bad horror movie , n
this movie is bad news n
the multiple story line all go from bad to silly by the picture end , n
when he was a kid or insulted him , z
sitting through this entire god-awful `` film '' n
that i can never experience anything as bad as this again . n
( she is gorgeous and not a terrible actress ) . p
duvall 's appearance is reincarnation at it is best . z
one of my most favorite film . p
wonderful scenery and music and `` all too-true-to-life p
hooting and hollering.the movie is patched together pretty poorly n
some of the sound effect were pretty bad . n
that can normally become annoying after a few minute . n
the kid in paperhouse have managed to capture the worst of both world , z
as they are both very annoying n
in spite of the premise being an excellent premise for lot of inventiveness ; p
and the result is an entirely boring experience . n
as the horror in the movie is laughable at best . n
paperhouse is poorly acted n
very corny and dull on the whole . n
this is truly awful n
unfortunately z
from being the worst movie ever made . n
that he finds it extremely funny z
heard about this movie just recently on a message board z
that is rare z
i am afraid this film will always just be a lost gem . p
it places itself as one of my all time favorite . p
that makes a bad movie worth watching - sloppy editing n
bad n
pointless story line n
and it is perfect for mst3k-style riffing , z
take a shot - catch a bad foley edit ... take many z
because despite its insane badness , p
who try to do the best z
unfortunately z
making fool out of all of their peers.the show boasts excellent camera-work . p
the lead in and the fade out are always superb . p
unfortunately the story is a cartoony n
always escaping and making fun of all the elmer fudds n
he always blames the suspicious cop , z
boring n
that are the character ' corrupt act and the inevitable cover-ups.most disappointing though , z
sometimes they want us to see him as a poor misunderstood soul . z
sometimes they want us to see him as a poor guy with a heart of gold . z
but the whole movie was for me completely chaotic and stupid . n
and the bad-ass won and i think z
the acting was really bad , n
( and in the slovak dabbing just stupid , n
all the compositional device bach perfected to keep his listener z
and another thing is that player give some of their best performance away from their home studio.rock hudson got such accolade for his performance in the texas based film giant z
let 's quick get him into another modern texas setting.similarly robert stack got great review for the high and the mighty as the pilot z
dorothy malone spent over 10 year in a whole bunch of colorless film heroine role before landing this gem . p
she got a best z
whose work is not to look great first and kick butt later . z
sweet valley high category of `` best friend '' or `` sister . '' z
despite an excellent screenplay by samson raphaelson and fine performance from its two lead and frank morgan in a supporting role . p
this subtle subtext ings a more meaningful p
and their interaction are always believable and enjoyable . p
but billy wilder learned from the best . p
inging an important message about the temporal cold war from the suliban sarin to the leader of the klingon in krono.in spite z
hoshi and trip is excellent p
which i found very annoying , z
but this was an exception in this great show . p
this movie begins with an ordinary funeral ... z
and it insists so hard on this ordinary funeral feel n
but preparation for a funeral.. my grandma on her last year was fascinated by funeral , z
perhaps she might have enjoyed this `` movie '' . z
this movie is bad , n
this is probably the worst movie n
it is just to bad the name of roger corman is associated with it . n
vampire club makes the top of my list of the best of worst.it is hard to imagine n
he is in a vampire movie at all witch is too bad 'cause z
he had a `` not to bad '' career over all . z
loosely linking a half a dozen story of the worst kind of depravity z
for me the treatment of the retarded girl by the security equipment salesman was about the worst episode , n
while avoiding the local authority , z
i like stupid comedy but this one did not offer many laugh . n
it was a pretty dull picture with the first hour n
but none of the lead were very funny . n
but she is a weak actor . n
which was pretty funny . p
though as the story is a mess . n
the duke of hazzard barely has enough funny gag n
but most person will probably find it dull n
rating 4/10 n
as blood rite was entirely awful , n
as we focus on a dysfunctional family unit , z
and despite a poor reputation , z
as many of the sequence in this film are actually quite beautiful . p
and the director also does a surprisingly good job with the sex scenes themselves , p
this is not a great film ; n
because the majority of the whole stupid film is revolved around a map of a cemetery . n
not to mention how many of the same boring shot of the map there are . n
it is that bad . n
so why the 3/10 rating ? n
do not waste your money on this garbage . n
not surprisingly so have all of his other movie ! z
7/10rated r : p
( i mean horrible beyond belief ) n
but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good . p
but i was not too disappointed . p
this movie is surprisingly good-natured . p
`` the dream machine '' is no gem , n
it is quite forgettable n
that make this among errol flynn 's greatest outing in a career of great outing . p
is notice the great montage p
he would go on to a great career as action director himself . z
this movie fails to strike any sort of likeable chord throughout n
and therefore funny ' john linette . z
i wholeheartedly believe this movie to be the worst zombie movie of all time . n
that stupid torch guy sacrifices his life n
the hindenburg was a rare event z
that god with increase my ain capacity long enough for me to figure out all the subtle nuance in feeding the masses.anywho , z
but who seems to be plagued with bad luck . z
i am reminded of the episode of michael moore 's illiant the awful truth , z
it seems to be eaking up by the blow of bad luck like an asteroid z
he loses his temper on live tv in one of the funniest scene of the entire film.morgan freeman delivers a fantastic performance p
that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans. z
one of the biggest strength is that the movie is able to provide great advice to person in general about improving their life , p
and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewer 's religion . p
i was able to appreciate the message p
that were delivered in this movie.jim carrey 's movie display this fantastic evolution p
( both of which i loved p
it is amazing how far he is come . p
( easily one of his greatest film ever ) . p
working today.jennifer aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie p
which empower the message even more.the scene p
that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film p
and my favorite p
the movie has plenty of time for carrey to deliver some excellent joke , p
i also loved the end p
that behind every great man is a woman z
behind every great man is also an amazed mother-in-law.bruce almighty is one of the more memorable comedy p
which is becoming rarer and rarer these day . z
this great film is composed mostly of documentary footage is currently contained on a dvd along with prelude to war . p
the great american filmmaker and story teller frank capra made these film z
when you let dictator eak treaties.these great film p
that led to the terrible war . z
gore vidal 's 1968 bestseller was a darkly satirical statement . z
but worse z
is largely wasted . n
relentlessly unfunny from start to finish . n
sarne never quite seems to understand that the appeal of the film for a gay audience arise from his ridiculously inaccurate depiction of homosexual person . n
-- and quite frankly the single worst choice of writer and director n
than sean ellis did in 88 minute with this tedious snooze . n
sadly z
this movie provides a refreshingly different look at barbarian . p
not because it is funny or anything mundane like that n
but because it is so bad n
fun . p
my favorite actor in a historical drama during the independence war . p
military fight and from `` barry lyndon '' for the british and candle light atmosphere ... unfortunately , z
the script is awful : n
and the romance is so ridiculous n
a bad script is saved by a illiant filmmaker . p
unfortunately bis z
hudson is a poor one . z
dull n
to achieve perfection z
and by doing this may miss out on a great opportunity . z
watching the film an enjoyable experience..a must see for anyone p
excellent work ... ... joanne p
you will be very very disappointed . n
i was somewhat disappointed n
probably the worst part of the movie . n
this was a good family movie with some weak point . p
i rate this movie 7/10 . p
honestly i can not express in word how bad this film actually is . n
the hilariously dreadful excuse for zombie ; n
every little thing in this film is either stupid n
pointless n
that is how bad it is . n
it would be hard to imagine a worse director . n
when that annoying little runt swing across the stage on a rope , n
this movie just makes you want to choke them.perhap broadway annoying trend of character walking directly to stage center n
but the worst imaginable revival of the play will make you feel more alive than this movie . n
ridiculous horror film about a wealthy man n
and the house itself looks beautiful . p
; some of the sound recording was so bad i could not make out the dialogue n
( no great loss i am sure ) ; z
the gore was sparse and very poorly done ; n
the other murder were simply boring n
stupid or impossible and this movie contains some truly abominable acting n
-- so bad you just stare at the screen in disbelief . n
even pro jeff morrow was terrible ! n
-- the closing line in this movie is a gem ! p
it is a bad movie . n
to be avoided at all cost . n
digitally remastered and a new print made for the fantastic film fest , z
( one of the best comedy sequence ) , p
but is disappointed at the teaching method - kinda like mr miyagi 's style in karate kid z
but it is rather refreshing watching the fight scene here , p
as a made all the worst by the utterly laughable dialogue n
bad dialogue n
to come up with this gem ! p
about how much zp lacks plot , n
when zp was quite rare ) z
when the crap blows up to the soundtrack of pink floyd 's wonderful re-working of `` careful with that axe z
this is an amazing film p
both for the incredibly energy evoked from the frenetic flamenco dancing p
you do not need to love opera or flamenco z
subtle and direct ; loud and still ; one of p
if not the best , p
this was one of the most boring , n
poorly written n
consider to be the worst film of all time ... battlefield earth . n
it also features some of the worst dialogue i n
have ever heard ... like this little gem ... guy tells girl p
since it looked so ridiculously cheap and the sound fx of the guy n
avoid it at all cost . n
this movie is so bad n
awful . n
is truly amazing . p
and the directing is superb . p
i absolutely loved it . p
it is beautiful , p
that is the best way p
this is without doubt rajnikanth 's worst movie ever . n
the first part is held in place with solid comedy from goundamani p
but it progressively gets worse and worse and completely illogical . n
through a corny and utterly lame one-liner . n
the usual predictable crap with hilarious implementation . n
the bad guy and the usual politician villain are clich\u00e9d n
it was fun to kill time with and yell baba related one-liner during public event . z
its also fun to watch other curse about this movie . n
dressed and treated is absolutely pathetic . n
but the result of the movie itself would have killed off any of his political dreams.fun n
this wonderful film is all about the sickening realization p
testing and tweaking his military superior , z
leaves the viewer with the impression that the drug war is largely a futile exercise and a waste of money n
make it impossible for drug seller to enforce their contract and business arrangement in court of law , z
the drug themselves seem to take the unt of the blame . z
will help to perpetuate ridiculous stereotype of drug user , n
but unfortunately there is an epidemic in this nation of an as-yet unnamed disease z
it is pretty disappointing . n
that i only paid us $ 1.4 and i could have such a surprisingly delightful p
this should be the greatest retribution to the unfaithful act of their spouse . z
i very much enjoyed `` the revolution will not be televised '' . p
is unfortunate that in venezuela the twenty percent of wealthy citizen have made all of the decision for the eighty percent of the poor for decade z
yul brynner has one of his best role as the pirate king , p
inger steven is beautiful ; p
it is a beautiful and nearly a very-fine motion picture . p
that eastwood deliver wonderfully through clenched tooth before single handedly foiling a robbery . p
very badass and it just what fan can expect from him . p
but fan that were looking for another badass harry outing will more than likely be somewhat disappointed . n
-- - 7/10rated r for violence and a rape scene p
ill-conceived and poorly assembled scene n
this is a true and complete waste of time n
and made a staggeringly great piece of work on the same subject p
well it is not a great help to the film . n
the print was so bad n
it looks cheapo ! n
begins a love affair merely for fun with yacht salesman richard davis z
that makes for a boring rather than charming set of lovebird , z
great movie and the family will love it ! ! p
this movie features two of my favorite actor in kilmer and downey . p
it also boasts the always enjoyable larry miller in a too-small part . p
that director shane black fails to achieve.i share a birthday with shane black but a look at his credit z
the choreography is fantastic throughout , p
particularly the sympathetic monk work perfectly for the material . z
with a subtle yet warming tale of a useless guy p
that this film is indeed bad . n
maybe then the bad acting would not have been as noticeable . n
many of the action scene were just pointless.it was a complete waste of my time . n
or does she just have a really bad case of multiple personality disorder ? z
and most of the action center on him.newbern 's character is pretty sympathetic , z
the mediocre to z
which is so badly conceived , n
but avoid a first-person encounter . z
the small and subtle irony p
with beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventy p
there '' is a great indie-film p
not only has he sold his best friend ray a beautiful country home , z
no doubt bernice 's initially superficial demeanor and ridiculous hairstyle detract from his ability to `` rebound '' with her . z
this movie is a 90 minute ramone concert with ief period of stupidity and absolute boredom . n
do not and i repeat do not waste your time like i did . n
rachel york was fantastic as `` lucy . '' p
in great depth . z
rachel was terrifically fresh and funny in these scene . p
it ings a flood of great role her way in the future . p
that escape me - find the dialog fascinating . p
these kind of movie are not funny n
they are just boring . n
have fun . z
best film i have ever seen . p
although i do not mention it in great detail . z
and some beautiful shot of vegetation p
a near perfect presentation of the variety of life and landscape and climate on earth . p
that it was going to be a cheap spin-off guided by ronald d. moore n
the pilot leaves an excellent impression upon the viewer . p
gives a wonderful glimpse of william 's heroic father . p
is my favorite movie of all time . p
so how on earth could they make a sequel so downright bad . n
sarah michelle gellar was perfect in the first movie . z
she is terrible . n
robin dunn is not as bad as adam , p
but he is absolutely terrible n
it basically goes like this ... 1- sebastian has a bad rep at his first school , z
you ever loved z
its terrible . n
and i loved the first one so much . z
it up with a redeeming , p
not a great film n
but certainly an enjoyable one . p
this was awful . n
andie macdowell is a terrible actress . n
and the highly stupid storming of the wedding might just have worked z
that kate would ever speak to molly again after her terrible behaviour . z
forsaking any scare whatsoever for unfunny attempt at humor and needless celeity cameos n
this is tied with part 2 is the worst n
not even the great legendary alice cooper could make the stench of this movie go away . n
the mtv movie were all bad n
this is the worst documentary n
( which i admit is a little funny ) p
intends to do in `` the best of time '' . z
it is not the best movie for either man . n
and was not disappointed . p
its so bad n
that it is actually funny in a very cringe worthy way.gael n
is absolutely terrible , n
so ridiculous.. somehow i do not think n
but this movie was so bad i felt compelled to do so.if you get the chance n
that in a good and bad way.the plot is really simple . z
that he still tries to be best friend with stiller cause stiller z
is odd funny ? p
after the screening i heard person call it horribly unfunny and glad n
who rated it so poor . z
they would rather see a movie with cheap thrill n
reel.com 's review is the perfect example z
as if trying to make an original movie for a change- very rare these days- z
is something bad and not worth it.i will reveal some spoiler for the moron n
it was boring n
that this movie did not hit your local cinema with the great direction z
it was pointless and vulgar . n
andie mcdowell is surprisingly good in a character roll , p
and this is a great rock'n'roll movie in itself . p
and you have got one of the great stoopid movie of the day . p
that this is one of the great movie p
not the least for the lovely leading lady and the great ramone footage . p
the great depression ings many bank closure z
astounding ... ..this may have been a poor attempt at remaking the already recreated oman movie , n
but i sure enjoyed it.that last man p
would had applaud this movie.great recommendation from myself to watch or buy this film.i collect horror movie and soundtrack , p
there great movie ... p
before the great depression falls upon us , z
i watch bad movies.this movie is not good enough z
to be a bad movie . z
i see a bad movie and curse . n
this was so bad , n
to try and save other from the completely boring mess i fell victim to.i am n
smashing my copy of this movie.it is too lame even to use clear a room . n
so boring . n
this sludge looks awful n
is awful , n
it should feel awful . n
this amazing documentary gives us a glimpse into the life of the ave woman in cameroun 's judicial system p
is a rare thing z
many of the character are unsympathetic , n
to show the folly on both side.much of the cinematography was excellent ; p
i especially loved the scene p
( perhaps the best i have ever seen ) , p
( surprised the hell out of me ... after true romance and beautiful girl i p
an amazing soundtrack p
( although the tori amos song started to *really* annoy me by the end ... not her best work ) . n
great script p
great film . p
8/10 . p
who unfortunately must flounder through this alleged 'screw-ball ' comedy . n
fortunetly for donna reed her best day are ahead of her culminating in from here to eternity z
and her oscar win as best supporting actress . z
( which can sometimes be fun p
but alas not for miller.her dancing seems awkward and poorly choreographed z
her singing somewhat limited and as an actress she makes ruby keeler seem like hepburn.even worse in this film n
she was poorly served by the cinema n
`` the mother '' does an excellent job of dealing with uncomfortable issue realistically n
while avoiding gratuitous sensationalism . z
will play best with more mature audience z
it is not really stupid p
but it is cheesy fun . p
it is fun to watch . p
7/10 p
not bad ... . p
tedious n
boring story line n
the conventional and predictable story of the most famous form of prostitution from the asian continent n
lacks heart n
boring n
the movie is just plain boring , n
it is beautiful to look at , p
the messenger you wont believe the message , n
boring n
the more i grew to love it along with the message p
that actually conveyed a life message to its audience . p
this movie is best described or compare to `` big fish '' z
it is funny p
that the sentinel was going to be a mediocre movie.when i n
i took a good surprise.the movie is not great thing n
but it is very fun p
to the wolfgang petersen 's thriller in the line of fire.if you are going to expect one of the most original and and one of the greatest thriller in the history of movie , z
the acting was the worst , n
the effect were really bad as well , n
the main guy was the worst actor ever ... n
the only good thing about this movie was it was so bad n
it was funny ... so n
this one is the worst i n
have seen..and i have seen some bad one . n
what a little gem of a film ! p
or as a well-written/acted gumshoe/film-noir . p
great simon oakland ; p
unavoidable for a modest-budget p
and a bad one n
( played dismally by a boring stuart townsend ) . n
and giving him a scully-type partner is also a lame idea ; n
take a beloved cult series z
and find a rare artifact about columbus ' hidden treasure z
i reckon this part of the story was a waste of time , n
which to me is a complete waste n
stupid character and a boring climax . n
frailty is an excellent and a truly original horror movie . p
it within the top 10 most favorite horror movie on my list.movie begins with snapshot of photo and news article p
that he has received a divine message from god z
and it is one of my all time favorite horror-thriller . p
the great colours and the set get me going too . p
such as fantastic classic movie p
classic example of great attempt at telling simple story , p
hmmm ... .great performance in this movie from leslie nielsen p
the special effect are fantastic , p
this is a great sci-fi experience ! p
the best p
their adventure through the gaily decorated hollywood backlot are fun p
it was great to see computer-besotted kid in an affluent community respond with cheer and applause to special effect p
this is one of the best of its kind.9/10 . p
i loved the commentary . p
it is the worst movie ever made and 'unendurable ' is the perfect word for it , n
unless there is something worse n
the best p
the poor woman is just horrible in the thing are looking up number . z
the surreal fun-house sequence is marvelously staged.p.g . p
wodehouse 's aristocracy runs the gamut with constance collier at her haughty best and for once montagu love as fontaine 's father as a nice man z
maybe the best known song about the british capital city z
done in the best simple elegant manner by fred astaire , p
this is a wonderfully goofy example of a self produced p
`` this is the worst piece of sh*t i have ever worked on ... n
it was possible to release a movie this bad . n
this is not a bad thing ! p
it even saves some episode from getting boring ! p
are the wonderful character ! p
good or bad ! z
that is why we watch these flick ... i would not waste my money on it ... n
to o'herlihy 's awful accent in later episode , n
but avoid anything after that , n
with increasingly worse story line and sensibility. n
the old bandw film is by far the best of any form of entertainment with the colditz name p
i am a huge fan of ivan reitman-i loved evolution p
it is not awful-it just sit there like a stale cracker behind the fridge.this could have been such a illiant send-up of superhero movie and feminism n
but fails on both counts.let 's see n
that effort and expense go to waste , n
after mr. spock receives an urgent message from the former commander of the enterprise . z
surprisingly z
the message can not be from captain pike after all , z
will be disappointed , n
gore fan will be disappointed since , n
playing the victim might be one of the worst in history.regardless of what person say , n
avoid it . n
where the usurer shylock makes a terrible bond with the merchant antonio , z
unfortunately n
however devoured by the pain for the death of his beloved and of other person z
without feeling bad , n
the best description z
is really wonderfalls meet dead like me in the best way possible.i am z
to be a wonderfully imaginative playground . z
there is an excellent hospital scene p
garfield was perfect for the role p
of being a great film p
because they have so many great actor p
not bad as such but with redgrave p
when her great aunt dy z
she is disappointed to find z
that her great uncle is secretly an evil warlock and very intent on laying hand on `` the old book . '' z
it is a tremendous amount of fun , p
will elvira best her evil uncle and save the day ? z
you will have a lot of fun p
recommended.gft p
but plot was a little weak n
i gave this a 5/10 . n
avoid it , n
and to utilize 116 minute of your life better.the buddy-cop movie are fun . n
the worst of them was by all mean greater n
and the worst of them all yet n
the negligent dealing and the dull humor . n
where both have been badly made.the acting n
is terrible . n
some part managed to be highly dull n
; it is a rare time to be boring in what supposed to be action/comedy ! n
to end up as one of the worst case of 2 star with non-chemistry on the screen n
this is one of the best effort p
film like this are rarely made and appreciated . p
this started bad , n
got worse , n
avoid this film n
but loved by the fan , p
mixing supposedly 'surreal ' footage shot at john lennon 's home among other place with live footage of marc bolan and t.rex at their very best , z
who 's liked marc bolan but gives a fascinating insight into the era.these were the time p
to you ] bashing the ivory in an amazing [ z
and never officially released ] version of tutti fruttus and rocking and ballad version of child of the revolution.there is also wonderful scene p
! the best scene for me is in the garden p
highly recommended ! ! p
sctv star andrea martin has one funny scene . p
it was funny at time . p
emma robert did a great job . p
that i throughly enjoyed p
that it was the worst film i n
injected into the proceedings with all the subtlety of a `` gilligan 's island '' episode . n
and some of the player have a little fun : p
lee grant is an obnoxious drunk z
compellingly awful n
( and not in a fun way ) n
limited coherence and predictable ending ; n
your worst film are work of art n
in which albert finds himself in various ridiculous situation , n
couple this with quincy jone ' ridiculously `` white '' music , n
only because the man are too stupid n
ie- respect one another in your poor minority community z
3/10 - a failure to confront sex and lesbianism n
and delivered a message.jon voight and ned beatty are also excellent . p
10/10 . p
- the direction and 'mood ' is perfect , p
i thoroughly enjoyed this p
so that is promising.10/10 p
the main drawback to this movie is that the acting is pretty bad . n
the actor playing the killer are kind of fun ... p
what a waste of 2 perfectly good hour . n
or this was a really bad movie . n
that is made with a rare understanding and respect . p
and the screen rarely venture far from the house of the two female protagonist . z
she begs her beloved sister to return . z
but what she does there is never told \u0096 the subtle dialogue z
but there is a mix-up.this is a very energetic musical with great dancing z
not one of my favorite voice , n
iturbi 's piano work is beautiful.sinatra gets to show his versatility p
this was a major eak for him at mgm.wonderful movie p
which explains the ridiculously high rating for this p
unfortunately it was a bit ahead of it is time , p
subtle p
jumping back and forth between a beautiful z
that his film was too beautiful to cut . p
and it was downright disturbing to witness one of my favorite film `` vandalised '' in this way . n
otherwise avoid this insidious disaster like the plague . n
this movie is perfect for anyone p
this movie is perfect for anyone p
who enjoys everything from the mundane to the fantastic in realism p
were fun to watch , p
and this movie had plenty of those.i give it 9/10 p
only because i am saving my 10/10 for that yet unseen super magnificent movie p
it is true that their record were great , p
( and audience ) had settled down to long and often amazing display of musical virtuosity p
what you especially learn here are the amazing thing p
it really is amazing . p
as for my beloved history channel 's `` reel to real '' follow-on documentary z
amazing how each vampire movie has some set of moray for the respective vampire . z
it is almost funny , n
this one also has the vampire-bursting-into-flames special effect . z
unfortunately the more i watched it the more i realised n
i might have enjoyed this movie as a fifteen year old schoolboy in 1982 n
which leads to a ridiculous end scene n
bunch of terrorist eak in to scientific base leading to all sort of disaster with the military being the bad guy n
the movie contained superb acting great fighting and a lot of the location were beautifully shot p
great effect p
another solid effort by tadanobu asano in my opinion . p
but ... ..this is the worst `` film '' n
worse than the avenger . n
and awful acting are the only consistent element throughout . n
shot on very cheap video , n
but everything else about this thing is just awful . n
and the editing looks worse than a rough cut . n
it is not even bad enough to be funny . n
it is just bad . n
a great christmas movie ? p
dull n
bland and completely lacking in imagination and heart . n
baransky was great as usual p
that it was going to be amazing , p
unfortunately most of the song n
that i loved were nowhere n
but this version was sadly disappointing n
that the sound was really bad through out n
this young man is an excellent actor p
whose performance encompasses his wonder and subtle realization p
that this will go down as one of lee ang 's `` great '' movie , p
who all came across as real and imperfect human p
i was quite disappointed n
the best factor of this film is the song ! p
the song are excellent p
shankar-ehsaan-loy done an excellent job p
and have done an excellent job over the year . p
because of the excellent song ! p
one thing i was disappointed with , n
the best acting was performed by salman and priyanka overall , p
by singing it.the sound track is great ! p
the animation is great , p
the animation in both movie are fantastic . p
that the animation for the time was excellent . p
that this movie is great , p
it is a wonderful movie.basically , p
but the story was pathetic , n
the dialog was pathetic . n
this is not one of those really great indie film n
there were no redeeming quality to this movie at all . n
a complete waste of my time and money . n
inequity and darkness ; ight and beautiful on top with a dark underbelly beneath . z
it is heavily influenced by film noir z
who was dying of something terrible z
built up for month to a fantastic climax , p
leaving everybody far behind in amazement.do not give me a poorly acted , p
poorly directed flick about some woman n
the ridiculous ending n
*spoiler* this is an appallingly bad piece of film , n
together with a ridiculous ending . n
having enjoyed jean arthur in `` the devil and miss jone '' , z
i dreaded a self-indulgent yuppie flick about relationship gone bad . z
and takes a message . z
he tells her how beautiful she is z
that the artwork are bad . z
who needs a sympathetic ear . z
the best carol kane role p
so as to realize what a great movie it was . p
the premise is ridiculous n
so i can not really blame them . z
and the cast seem to be having fun with the goofy plot..it is so preposterous n
that he can rekindle a dead flame n
how ludicrous/laughable it looks n
boring n
and how does this psychotic character function in his daily life ? z
nearly 8/10 average score ? p
that it is the worst movie i n
it was funny '' . p
that would be fun at party full of rowdy van damme fan z
gagool an old baddie witch in the book and some precursor to gollum has been turned into a nice gal ! z
it won the award `` best short film '' at the 6th fantasia film festival p
they encounter many fantastic character and remarkable , p
stunningly beautiful p
and possess a great sense of strangeness and lyricism . p
a great journey for those z
and the action sequence are great . p
stupid ? n
stupid jane seems to have forgot how tough tarzan is , n
this movie is far from bad p
i love bad movie . p
( i mean really bad ) dialogue , z
( the part i liked best ) . p
a very enjoyable film for those p
and starts butchering them whilst leaving behind the titular message as some sort of business card . z
which i really loved , p
and maybe that was a neutral idea or a very stupid one . z
that this movie was a remake of some old bad western movie about a cowboy doing 'ave deed ' in the wild wild west infected with 'evil ' red indian ; z
one of the funniest character from the book is absent from this filth . n
that rarely seem to be leading anywhere overall . n
where he gets together with rudd 's equally annoying lying n
that makes no pretense to being anything other than entertainment with a whole bunch of the best actor around z
-- that he would even waste his time engaging in such a fruitless z
that he could pull it off and unfortunately for moviegoer i was right n
of putting it on u.s. television.sort of like the sadly miscast american version of the sublime brit-com coupling n
but she makes a perfect foil for dalton z
and made him look slimmer and younger when in the film he looks like crap.he has his big pot belly and double chin going for him and the most miserable and bored look on his face.the whole plot was ridiculous to begin with and drawn out way too long.the whole film was leading up to the finale where seagal and his team had to take on a bunch of person under the influence of a top secret military chemical adrenaline enhancer.there was way too much useless dialogue and not to mention the ridiculous and constant dubbing of seagal voice even in the middle of a statement.the dubbed voice sounded like a man with a frog in his throat n
who has had his medical license pulled for unexplained reason.he is however doing experiment to keep his wife young and beautiful.it is revealed that she is 70-80 year old yet lugosi look to be in his mid 50 's so why he is married to this old woman is never really explained.anyway these treatment or experiment involved giving ide who are at the altar being married some sort of sweet smelling substance whereby they pass out but are thought to be dead.then lugosi and some of his assistant steal the body on its way to the morgue and take it back to his lab where it is kept in some sort of suspended animation or catatonic state.then the stolen ide have a needle rammed somewhere in their body z

who sound like keanu reeve with a cold anywhere close to funny.i can not stand this show n
unfortunately z
( it is the best comedy or musical tv show ever ) p
but then the film becomes funny p
it was a lot of fun rooting for hop-a-long cassidy . p

'earth ' is definitely one of the best p
was great but different . p
but the story is poorly told . n

( sanjay kapoor ) , z
and the film had some of the worst character development i have ever seen . n
some scene are wonderfully created : p
for some bizarre reason - and i only have myself to blame - i watched the whole thing , n
my advice is to avoid renting n
this is the most ludicrous and laughable thriller i have ever seen . n
interspersed with multiple boring sex scene . n
awful acting and you know what ? n
though the best moment are the silent moment , p
sadly enough.nonetheless this was a great movie , p
do not waste your money . n
and one of those rare gem that seemed to be without any boring lull p

( surprisingly due to spider-man 3 z

3/10 . n
this so-called prequel is just a badly made remake n
his co-star is the beautiful gene tierney , p

seeing this unwatchable mess . n
this movie gets a 9/10 from me . p
that i actually enjoyed this film right up to final scene p
to be funny . z
the film fails to impress . n

at least not to any great extent . z
if the big bad swim has any message or higher meaning or metaphor , z

the hilarious sabertooth squirrel.ice age was sporadically funny and overall fun film to watch . p
that is funny ! ! ! p
sadly z
that my flat mate and i ended up laughing and cringing at the ridiculous acting and cheesy script n
the use of facial image throughout the film is superb , p

the film is weak and boring . n
failing even to be a good-bad film.every scene n
over-earnest mess , n

best regard z
bad music n
but this one is my favorite . p
i am purposely trying to avoid any direct reference to the movie z
the song picturization and dancing is perfect for the crude lyric of the song . p
because it showed joe strummer not as the punk icon we all knew and loved , n

this takes marie away from her former best friend z
it is bad.1/10 n
( too bad little if any of that made it onto shakti 's soundtrack cd , n
it is annoying to have to take the idiocy of someone like sinatra 's character seriously . n
he is simply illiant as a man stupid and evil enough to put his family in misery , z
it does not explicitly give us any sense of great tension between human decency and the despotic school system , z
that was not even remotely funny n
this is just a succession of bad number n
to say about this waste of time . n

he is effective as the accused man 's best friend . p
fascinating p
as if to add insult to the injury , z
for creating intimate character.the most incredible is the fact p
it is right there in the title - `` the incredible melting man '' . z
so apparently scary movie star are forced to end out their career with bad scary movies.my rating : n
because it displays the greatest comic genius of them all at his best . p
great . p

the `` best friend '' relationship between shaggy and scooby-doo z
reclaiming such hollywood-narrative standbys as the best friend and the defiant happy ending p

not only does the director fail to make use of imax 's incredible 65 to 70 mm film stock and gigantic presentation screen , n
shot perfectly in crisp black and white p
so it is an incredible burden . z
they are meant to be fun z
and not very funny . n
it talks about rpg gamer is not funny as well . n
that the film fails in its message lies in actual real world reaction to it . n

the concept of `` miami golem '' contains element from numerous great sci-fi and adventure flick p
this could of been an excellent short film , z
that this little gem continues to remain buried . p
that so many of these a list star would agree to this unfunny film . n

and everyone is treated sympathetically . p
best performance stacey walker . p
while it was dull , n
that is sadly overlooked by the public . p
and refreshing about this movie was its ignoring p

by showing terkovsky in the midst of a horrible dream- one of polanski 's strongest scene from the period- and in finding tooth in the wall , z
diana rigg is bad in her role n

this is just an incredible document of a little known group of person p
this film actually has some redeeming quality to it . p
before betraying its audience with cheap scare tactic and an incoherent storyline . n
that at time is unintentionally funny the film is highly entertaining . n
he kills what apparently is the only nurse in the hospital and escapes to the neighboring town to stalk more victims.i liked the premise p
they make it even more fun ! 8.5/10 p

well recommended at any rate . p
that could make any since i would have given it a 8/10 but the ending made no since . n
mediocre musical score , n

it does contain one funny scene p
the judge is sympathetic to all the woe-is-me of the sexy sweet young thing . z

not only do they suddenly appear at some very funny time and in some funny way , z
to help the american government 'get their message across ' to turaqistan 's leader . z
without messing it up ! z
the plot is wonderfully convoluted , p
funny and hearteaking story about 'spending your eighth day ' - your own day ! p
this dvd version features yet more tweaking z
and still makes him a simpathetic character . z
robert deniro and cuba gooding junior played riveting and amazingly strong part p
were totally fascinating . p
the mst3k guys never got hold of this movie . z

and funnier = better . z
the story line of the film is laughable at best n
but `` juice '' was a funny character.if p
with funny situation p
who was not so perfect , n
it is just a reflection of his younger greatness.allen p
its ecological message is so forced and overstated n
so this was not the best time n
unpredictable and tough n
funny and incredibly irreverent beyond belief p
and you can not go wrong buying this for the youngsters.7/10 p
woody 's rarely made a funnier movie . p
( played by kareena kapoor ) , z
but it is absolutely perfect for what it really was meant to be : p
he is funny.only funny person in the movie were danny mcbride and bill hader . p
this film has absolutely zero redeeming quality . n
what a waste of a wonderful title ! n
there has also been a greater than average amount of rain lately , z

the screenplay manages to do what the best of this type of movie does : z
which is sadly overlooked . p
all with the same message . z
they were funny p
i found blakey particularly funny , p
not recommended , n
not recommended . n
not recommended . n

not recommended . n
it is not superbly written - e.g. , n
it also fails to deliver its message in a convincing manner.the approach to the subject of painting is very elite n
while not the best of the wallace film , n
you will be very disappointed i am sure ! n
his film is a brechtian examination of the functioning of institution z
and rupert grave a superbly nasty and self-pitying villain . n
and really weak special effect n
though aditya roy kapoor excel . p
the comedy is simply not funny . n
if you do not find the joke funny in the first place z
something so refreshing p
'they ' did not see welcome to collinwood.a fun p
that are also amazing.there are no word to express what this tv show really is p
who took on the title role of this b-movie adaptation of one of history 's greatest general . n
the dinner party could quite possibly be in my opinion the greatest adult cinema production of all time . p
his shot are annoyingly awkward n
the inelegant animation is stuck somewhere between the weakest walt disney and the less-inspired show from hanna-barbera , n
who lives in villa and dine in the best french and italian restaurants.i do not remember seeing any major western movie about the tiananman massacre of thousand of student in china . z
how rare is that ? z
that they will probably find it equally enjoyable if watched again in a year 's time ; p
though you can easily recognize the cheapness of the film , n
because it is traveling at a greater rate of speed , z
this could have been a very enjoyable formula film n
but no movie is perfect , n
( and funnier ) movie . p
the result was a funny book about his life . p
that greatest of hollywood year , z
this film should have been fun . n
some good and some bad , z
and the mixing of genre and incredible plot resolution are certainly their norm . p
and not only are alien visitor able to perfectly speak english z
and that this technically excellent biopic should have so little sting . p
while it is no great surprise z
after the 8th season it is not funny anymore n
the dialogue is insipid at best and insultingly stupid at its low points.i find n
i realise i am making this movie sound rather fun . n
the grandaddy of all dysfunctional family film . z
more fantastically the movie had a total black humorous undertone in it . p
but they are mainly just the great toxic `` zombie '' like in bruno matty `` hell of the living dead '' .so z
they just are not fun ! n
whether you watch the regular version of this monstrosity or the mst3k version , n
that not even the uncredited starkly staring eye of the great bela lugosi can alleviate the ain-numbing boredom . n
these kind of person are what give rpgs a bad name.also the corny 'love ballad ' n
nuit noire is a truly horrifying picture - for your eye p
because they are so funny together.when john p
there are moment where miike 's glacier-like sense of humour seep through the bland commercialism ; z
have you ever tried to remain standing on one of those spinning discs in a funhouse ? z
not right at al ... the movie may not have the best special effect , n
britain 's greatest ever screen actor does not seem too interested in this role , n
yet curiously charming.when bogart or mitchum stepped into a film noir role p
the ridiculousness of this show is often overlooked.it was followed by two really bad , n
while the acting is mediocre at best , n
that convey a clearly delineated message of salvation z
it never comes close to being as funny or watchable as master of the flying guillotine . n
so let 's give it 5/10 star . n
if it avoided some evident and exaggerative situation and symbolization in the end . n
funny person can be thoughtful too . z
when he is bad he is good . z
the story has be rock solid with a good dash of suspended reality p
recommended a+ . p
expected some cheap rambo 3 type action n
this movie could have been much better with a great director . n
to making this the perfect saturday night at home . p
i was not expecting this to be a great movie , p
mark damon kills a couple of bad guy in a funny manor - p
to make up for the lack of funding n
`` jane eyre '' has been one of my most beloved book z
he sure comes off as high and mighty and judgemental . z
this to me was the greatest flaw - n
( or even enjoyable ) p
especially to jealousy woman over 40 , z
( you can even call him ethan as a `` subtle '' nod to the mission impossible franchise . ) z
comedy wise it is somewhat funny . p
it is not until the `` perfect '' other makes the startling revelation z
that is vastly inferior to any 2009 best picture candidates.downey and co-star jamie fox are not to be blamed for this mishap . n
it is best to just enjoy the movie for what it is and not take it too seriously- z
and more than one person lost their head in the situation.unfortunately , z

it turned the smallest subtlety of the slasher film genre into comedic gold . p

that this would be a funny movie . z
it definitely was not perfect though . n
but there was a sense of greatness , p
the story and the message z
thereby redeeming himself in the eye of male everywhere . z
that you find the real message of the film . z
'sympathetic'..i will say 'charismatic ' villain in the history of the cinema p

also refreshing is seeing two gay man being portrayed as person and not cartoon . p
for i have seen many a bad movie.this masterpiece of modern cinema consists of two interwoven part p
this movie is just so much fun ! p
this film greatly exceeded my expectation . p
backed by a bs in chemistry and ms in business management , z

which is perhaps a cheap way z
the irony in this fact is that many of the joke are so audience insulting that even kid n
this movie could be perfect , p

while most horror fan will recognise the sexy caroline munro in a rare staring role . z

half a carto and a bottle of 151 later i finally found some of this g grade acting remotely funny . n
are weak at best , n
and turns it into a sappy melodrama about betrayal and jealousy between lover . n
that goes great with a six pack or any herbal remedy , z
van johnson also turns in a rather bland performance as a second rate jimmy stewart type . n
but not funny.i consider mel brook ' `` blazing saddle '' to be on the short list for funniest movie ever . p
the whole doo-dah act was funny , p
you would not all remain the best of friend . z
purported message of this film . z
message of this film . z
after he freaks out and eaks up with her.a promising premise is ruined by a mediocre execution . n
and then the chase is on.this movie is only recommended to those z
because she is just not funny . n
it only had one element not perfect ; n
he could have completely avoided introducing her family z
( the part where someone has a heart attack stands out as a bastion of bad film z
and the unpredictable force of nature z
is not a perfect movie n
but i did not have any problem connecting with the story of shakespeare in love or life is beautiful and i was not alive for either of those setting . z
maybe he could at least make 1 second worth of funny.this show may take the cake z
the weak script and the low-cost budget had created an amazing mix of foolish thing . n

and for good reason.unfortunately z
almost perfect ending ! p
the adult of the small and narrow minded town make thing worse z
while looking great is not much beyond that . z
they are funnier and better than every other movie combined . p
it is not by any mean a great film by cinematic standard , n
and even attending the funeral for the guy they had killed . z
the preview ruined several potentially very funny scene n
the end of the great war in 1918 was not a surrender but an armistice . z
i was also slightly disappointed by dominic purcell 's performance n
and the character act in the stupidest manner i have ever seen on screen . n
but there are much more romantic/funny comedy with john cusack.this is a mediocre film at best . n
not the best thing z
the blue-collar worker are threatened by everyone : management z
movie were actually starting to get entertaining and funny , p
i have never seen a worse movie in my life n

that is not always as much fun z

funny how many of the person z
no it was not good and with the best will in the world i wont be able to watch it again . n
it still turned out to a far bigger disappointment than i thought n
so just have fun with it . z
how they could make such a gem of a film with the very low p
brilliant execution p

one does not have to make their lead particularly handsome or beautiful , z
it never approached the level of awfulness of some of his earlier schlocky movie . n
movie are supposed to be enjoyable . z
featuring barbara belting out some of the weakest blather ever put to film . n
which minimizes the effect of the entire movie.i give it a 3/10 for the simple fact n
all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver n
there is also an obnoxious fellow passenger z
i do subscribe to what one could call the 'message ' of the film - namely art 's essential role in everyday life z
jimmy stewart was one of the greatest film star of all time p
and they must have used the cheapest camera n
and also a great snapshot of the worst z
clive barker 's serpent and the rainbow and james bond 's live and let die funeral scene z
syncopated funk/jazz score certainly hits the soulfully swingin ' spot . p
but fit perfectly with the feel of the overall piece . p

but it is not nearly as sympathetic.for instance , z

nick is such as an obnoxious fellow z
simply great movie no doubt about it . p
if you are setting out to watch bad movie . z
brilliant the way timone and pumbaa are ought back to life yet again p

edmund blackadder was number 3 on the 100 greatest tv character , p
peter seller and goldie hawn are very funny person p
i share not that fear and honestly do not appreciate some of the connection morris makes in the film.but i stress his subtlety . n

the editing is perfectly paced , p
that returns as non functional in one way or another from the store . z

better pacing would have made this a much more enjoyable movie.i have not seen many of these german krimis n
that their high school will be closed for asbestos removal z
they have made for good or bad in their own lives.well z
funnier/sadder version of where we were at a decade ago , z
swinging some cheapo camera backward and forward between 'actor ' n
and failing to find one.and therein lies the fatal weakness of the whole movie.mr j.hawkin likewise gives up early on n
its always funny and i was not checking my watch every minute . p
except that it is a perfect set up for a sakura killer 2. too bad chuck connor died . p
and rarely looks deadly.the last criticism is primarily based on the reality of the character 's action . n
but on its own the movie is mostly tedious.funny moment : n
has rarely had the audience acceptance of some of the other movie i z
and may go down as one of the funniest hollywood scene of all time . p
and made it plain bad '' .for a start its way too long . n

this film has pretty much nothing at all enjoyable about it . n

that has an even divison of races.2.insult the viewer intellect with its simplistic lines.3.the boy 's slezy father n
unfortunately for me n
purpose and message of this film.here is how i would summarize the film : z
it would be a b-film response to the dreadful darkness fall ; z
based on his hit play.great combination , p
she really can not act.harvey keitel should be ashamed of himself for working on such tripe.only recommended for those n
and the two agree to a 'no string attached ' night of fun . z
although their relationship is ight and fun to watch , p
when the record of yesteryear are highly questionable at best ? n
and the film 's dulled-out color is enervating . n
the film seems surprisingly cheap n
what fidelity is as well it once again proved to me how beautiful it is to live and believe . z

so i can not blame him . z
who is amazed of the refund n
moe and curly get blamed . z
a fake witch expert with atrocious pretension and bad manner . z
but the story fails to explain his prolonged fascination and love for davis ; n
unfortunately i have to agree with the critic n
in order to avoid confusion , z
doing something genuinely funny for a change . z
as it would spoil the fun , p
she is not really much fun to look at either , n
an amazing guy z
the duo find themselves in great danger z
straight to video-b movie or 'bad ' movie for your little liary collection then , n
in which even the great cary grant frequently appears flat and wooden , p
where we view horrible act of inhumanity to jew n
and clich\u00e9 ridden.i would refer person instead to bill bryson 's excellent survey of science : p
but funny and bad in a good way . p
that completely fails to capture the original adventure 's spirit . n
he had a terrible genetic condition z
he could be so bad . z
where person on the street of compton eak into happy song about their horrible life . p
after doing a terrible tv show . n
gone are the close bond between keye and neff and the erotic attraction between neff and phyllis.the look of jack smight 's take on `` double indemnity '' is more `` dynasty '' than film noir . z
that for a change karloff and lugosi are not unsympathetic toward each other . z
too bad i figured out will smith 's scheme early on n
bad thing is that she did not have much of a plan . z
a poor n
as there is not continuity from the good and bad rotoscoping ) , n
but anil kapoor 's grating hinglish dialogue makes you want to slit your wrist n
that she finally gets to show the whole world herself and her wonderful showgirl skill . p
if you want someone badly enough , z
unfortunately they do not ! n
so many fantasy movie safely avoided - a step to something new n
turn and whirl through the gloopy circumlocution of their own insignificance until the poor viewer is left alone with the conclusion n
but rob did the best he could , p

these might not be the best n
a successful career and a beautiful wife - pretty much everything most person want . z
to tell you how would spoil this very funny p
it is not nearly as well handled here than in those two superior film.melissa sagemiller star as cassie , n
( not bad tit and ass though ) . z
leaving franklin exposed as merely a good publicist rather than a prolific writer.the initial murder set-up is fantastic and cassidy 's performance facilitates an arguable accolade p
whose own inexplicably curious andy is impossible to believe.poor director harold becker is left trying to resurrect an impossibly dead project , n
the all-important message of violence begetting violence and the inspiring extent of motherly love were not the thought on my mind , z
at making someone `` badass '' in a movie . p

quit bad-mouthing the original , p
on the snl sketch and played out tediously for a whole hour and twenty-five minute . p
( 2 ) the filmmaker also develops the message of salvation through dialog . p
and wants to have some fun . p
i also enjoyed trying to place the episode p
but they are a community of person both good and bad , z
the whole project goes bad , n
i loved her drinking from a hot water bottle p
the blurb sites him as `` so funny in 'the 7 year itch ' '' . p
who was one of the city 's favorite son . z
because of it is noble message p
this movie is an absolute dud.having been recommended to me by a friend very much into `` that sort of thing n
and of having person sleep in stairwell is somewhat laughablebut don`t be fooled into thinking soylent green is a pile of corny tree hugging crap n
to avoid him , z
and they appear to be having a wonderful time . z
when i have heard such bad dialogue . n
and just wanted to have fun . p
and clearly the man has a great imagination ; p
and the total reaction is that everyone flinches.in the midst of an awfulness relieved only by the fetching julie newmar , z
horrible and frightening thing will happen , z
hitler bully and intimidates a poor z
that dark angel will become a cult favorite . p
to be funny.the hairstyle p
but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea , z
community and the inevitability of change have rarely been explored so expertly on film . p
to avoid clashing with ginger 's blonde hair ) z
and the overly grand hollywood interior have dreadful d\u00e9cor ; n
of getting laid with the best `` chick '' in the next mass hippie orgy . z
( obviously some based on jealousy ) z
( not much great coming in ) . n
i loved the message p
here they are replaced by the weaker red skelton and lucille ball . z
that can all perfectly fit into just the back of his truck ) z
great privilege to meet jon and the cast at the party p
to enable it to open up to new possibility is something rare in a film . p
that fails her z
when you have to work with dialogue this bad n
who do not even bother to learn the lyric to `` amazing grace '' n
but sadly due to right issue , n
too bad they could not have picked jeri ryan . n
poor everything , n
which is extremely powerful and sought after by the bad warlock p
unfortunately these thing did not matter at all . n
and that the saga actually ends with michael 's shockingly horrible act n
that unfortunately evil does exist in this world z
and generally being creepy.pat robertson does not even seem like such a bad guy at first glance . z
when the group left the `` boring '' seaside town z
but no where near plan 9 from outer space in badness n
at her best . p
everything he does no matter how bad . n
her best girlfriend z
mislead by the terrible lie on the cover n
who get a laugh out of really bad stuff n
before reaching fairly predictable place . n
that message is beat kid n
the extreme stereotype and message-laden dialogue just come off as charmingly outdated , n
what they can do with technology is amazing p
that he has a truly beautiful mind and soul . p
the jesse and celine tale avoid that , n
who encounters such horror and need to retaliate.a vile and pointless film then , n
while jame cagney poke fun at his screen persona and gordon macrae sing in his handsome baritone . z
is that the bad review seem to get him to wake up and realise n
because sadly n
the devastating news from his wife 's doctor arrives ... i can go on reflecting on all 18 small gem . z
a grade-schooler could come up with funnier stuff n
need to throw in one more scene with bad person coming in to beat up person n
bad by way of the superhero cheesiness n
and person in the theater began throwing thing at the screen during a particularly outrageous and insulting scene inside an orgy-type nightclub . n
a great opportunity has been missed to ing the japanese culture a bit closer to the oad western audience n
the only disappointing thing is that the only place i found to buy the season on dvd n
he is the perfect foil to julian ; p
you will love this version.if you love flamenco , p
a perfect laid back sunday morning movie . p
he had a bad experience z
and if you are that bad off - n
rarely is it seen as a growing film town . p
he sings the music in `` the great caruso '' with a robust energy ; p
picture bride has an excellent look into hawaii 's past and the person p
in light of bad review - or car crash - i feel possessed to get in gear n
my favorite gimmick from the show was how they always buckled their seat belt before roaring off , p
before could have lead to an entertaining and enjoyable movie - p
have heard about how scary and great these film are and i saw them all p
that a wiser and duller director would either avoid or not think of in the first place as usual n
tediousness z
and loved by the patriarch . p
using incredible amount of symbolism to convey truth p
harron fails to point out n
if you need a consistently funny film p
when the bad review started coming in eight year ago , z
after new episode continue to air.i have heard great thing p
although a love story between two boy with an artsy background could have been interesting by the great van sant . n
it can not all be blamed on mr. bush - after all , z
this would definitely be even greater experience , p
whose life is dedicated to have fun in the different club z
( with a funky irish accent ) p
in an ersatz-badass performance as shallow as her gorgeous look ) p
that rank with their best work , p
doing badly n
perfectly over the top ) threatens her life ... as well as her precious young daughters.this episode is warmly remembered by even those casually acquainted with the program . p
as either good or bad . z
unless you have a favorite sport team z
george was not really that great to his two guest . n
she managed to avoid a red rubber nose , z
unfortunately for the audience , n
unfortunately for the audience n
and a cheap rip-off of the other great fantasy killer such as freddy or pinhead . n
and need to put your ain on stupid . n
at being funny to be sadly buffoonish . z
after using the loo funny , p
unfortunately badly told . n
the footage from this movie is often eathtakingly beautiful and i many time wondered how on earth they could have taken some of the shot under water or in the sky . p
which could be subtlethe lengthy flashback could be avoided z
who could have been insufferably tedious n
in an explosion of laughter or tear .what remains to us is the beautiful cinematography of dougla sirk . p
but then suddenly the car is perfect again . p
that you have got mail is a poor adaption of this classic . n
when he smiled my knee went weak ! p
and reduced an intimate moment into a farce of biological function akin n
the funniest running joke in the movie is that the `` older '' doctor carradine constantly refers to his `` young '' assistant shayne as `` m'boy '' p
and almost poke fun at their reputation of bursting into spontaneous z
but it is a forgivable flaw in a surprisingly good sci-fi actioner.optimum 's uk dvd is a good transfer of the uncut 138-minute version . p
my beloved but forgotten ice junkie had melted into a sugary blue juice . p
not surprisingly the film disappeared from cinemas in cape town only two week after its release and from most of the cinemas in durban and gauteng . n
to escape the horrible actingjob put forth by drago . n
and the eventual message of this film makes episode of dragnet look evenhanded by comparison . p
that look at this insult to the intelligence n
usually undervalued western import his film noir persona n
but unfortunately with a huge capital u , n
that happened and the main character 's session with his psychiatrist feels a bit cheap n
who is an incredible jerk . z
beating 'good will hunting ' baise moi ' and 'flirt ' for sheer awfulness . n
its ok once but here its annoying and fake n
that sounds awfully similar to that of `` term of endearment '' , n
and george wendt is somewhat bland as her father p
they have loved and lost . p
when in fact there boring n
unfortunately they had forgotten how to act . n
national treasure unfortunately got a lot more publicity than those terrific film . n
and i enjoyed them more than his much more famous film p
and avoided this insipid n
a perfect ten would have been p
but they do act beautifully.i certainly do hope p
after a weak beginning z
gorris texture them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding p
you i did not care or find that funny . n
best known for directing with both speed and efficiency . p
woman and kid favorite p
and actress like anil kapoor z
check it out cause i have loved it p
the death of over a thousand of person on the greatest luxury ship of its time became a mere background . z
that had nothing to do with perfection : n
let me make note of this death - this is one of the rare movie p
michael bennett loved his reading , p
who is surprisingly effective as arthur , z
the 'vapoorize ' thing is sort of amusing at first . p
and perennial blaxploitation baddie tony n
if you like the fantastic genre p
( or best ) p
or unfortunately depending n
( who 's gay to avoid the tv taboo of inter-racial dating ) , n
or funny . p
or funny p
donald sutherland and john lithgow have great chemistry p
and i do not blame it one bit . z
but surprisingly z
( but surprisingly downbeat ) n
but surprisingly z
who shot the beautiful scenery in `` sideway '' p
to ... burst into flame ! z
and will continue to show it to all my friend annoyingly pointing out the funny bit p
and they know how to write a funny movie.you will notice in the credit of this movie p
as i am concerned and for the comment by kevnjeff about mr. paxton bad acting , n
but adult have as much fun as the kid do . p
who loved the first movie . p
like comparing this to those is an insult n
competent theme and solid construction by those p
that portrayed european as bad person z
where the dead king shine as a great light in the sky . z
who perform their role to perfection . p
as he had for her great-grandmother z
as a late steven seagal.the singer woman with the crazy eye is best p
so i blame marc lawrence and sam weisman . n
perhaps unsurprisingly , z
and they fought to lousy 80s music . n
he sadly passed away in season 2 , p
and even the incredible shrinking woman p
who loved me '' , z
who loved me '' z
definitely not the best example of this much-beloved genre . p
they are fun to consider in a 'what if ? ' p
they are fun to consider in a 'what if ? ' p
that icebergs may have floated into the hazardous northern crossing ... bill paxton is the opportunistic undersea explorer in search for a very rare diamond z
and highly sympathetic from a multitude of dimensions.the scary monster although probably not scary to most adult , n
the sight of kareena kapoor in a two-piece bikini is about the only thing n
who enjoyed loving on tokyo time , p
and one of the best trait of these film is that they do not really degrade in quality from one film to the next . p
that mst3k made fun of . p
you will miss out on all the campy fun ! p
leslie and joey should have been written with greater care n
if you need a healthy dose of all the solid , p
poor remake of bimalda 's classic parineeta . n
i would have loved to see what would have happened . p
wendy 's homecoming and this `` great battle '' are on exactly the same day . z
a beautiful young woman with strong opinion ; yali p
( or bad ) n
( or bad ) n
come across as sympathetic and for some never-explained reason z
where you start to doubt whether the director intended to convey the message n
you need solid filmic fundamental . p
filmed on a surprisingly lavish scale z
the bad thing : n
too bad they both died . z
and if you think of those wonderful soundtrack by michael nyman p
many time with no sense of function n
that visionary streak into a long career of unconventional and rare work of art . p
impressively directed and surprisingly well thought through , p
or funnier , p
guy and doll is never boring p
seven star for the mst3k version . p
a lot like a greatest hit tape , p
like an old friend of the family.a wonderfully crafted character-driven film from the director of `` driving miss daisy '' , z
fall in and out of love with some of the most quirky and beautiful woman p
and avoiding water . z
to poor n
especially now that it has found the perfect eternal home on late night tv and cable . p
who is going through a bad divorce . n
directed by uwe boll.based on the video game director uwe boll attempt to recreate the game into an action-packed nail biter sadly z
that some bad filmmaker wane bee got even financed n
it explores relationship at a fundamantal level z
or in those ridiculous lifetime channel movie , n
a lot of 70 's band like strange fruit behaved badly towards woman , n
and maybe because of that i enjoyed this simplification of the political and economic event p
but sadly , n
if the poor animal had a choice , z
that is very rare for an action film . p
poor old rossano brazzi z
michael curtiz at his best . p
it is important not to be insulted by lack of logic or common sense and those n
unfortunately for the nostril picker n
who has gone through such beautiful moment in their life . p
to build tension through badly lit shot of empty room and empty lawn , n
but kinda fun to read p
( the typical hottie who 's almost *too* perfect for the adolescent male fantasy figure ) . n
doing funny thing p
that sadly does not exist , n
that does not need a solid back-story n
his timing is very bad n
by doing a bad marlon brando imitation . n
than these two do with the best special effect and make-up person p
and the rest of the bad one-liner spouting gang all take turn revealing their biggest fear to the bearded dj . z
hearing those bad word coming out of a kid n
a woman faints next to his car ... quais de seine - another dull sequence , n
his expression is fantastically frightening . p
his life takes a turn for the worse z
for none have been bad . z
those with weak constitution will have some difficulty n
that god is a little greater than that . n
john woo - greater director of the century.maybe hi is not more intellectual than lot of big director ... n
a list of good point and bad point.i will start with the bad.bad point : z
and enjoy the wonderful and famous maslin beach with these wonderful nudist and their own personal story . p
a great big p
what is shocking and wild incollege rarely holds up over time , n
that the actor do their best with , p
then you must cater for english speaking audiences.it is amazing for me how such a small island p
that are never explained to any great deal of satisfaction . n
firing a hose at the inept comedy relief villain and dousing them in gunk for bad measure.the good point are few and far between . n
that really has no need of him.avoid like the plague . n
who has that great barbara steele kind of dark p
that all the humor in those bad skit is removed and replaced with stupidity . n
sorry for bad grammar or spelling . z
instead we have the guard almost sympathetically dealing with him z
but manages to short circuit the good stuff with bad . p
to be that bad . n
what could have been a great idea for a movie p
( the name of the notoriously `` unreadable '' french psychoanalyst is fundamental to \u008ei\u009eek 's thought . ) n
the shocking back drop dog fight scene are laughable . p
the movie does not hit the audience over the head with its message n
rory kinnear is amazingly convincing as an apparently hopeless fellow p
and turns out to be pathetic , n
the woman overacts to a terrible degree , n
the emotion this girl can arouse in your head are incredible , p
to be loved and the need p
their incredible speed . p
`` big bad mama 2 '' z
ranging from the blatantly obvious to the more subtler kind z
he feels bad ... z
the experience is rare . p
but sadly fail to do so , n
that the special effect have reached an even greater level of excellence . p
mind you - remember the incredible melting man , z
that is very irritating and sadly shows the flaw many scriptwriter tend to do p
the film appears to be a `` loving '' tribute to the greatest pin-up p
who surprisingly was not given a van dyke and pointy hairstyle . n
the core of the movie is the funeral z
`` direct to dvd '' typically is synonymous with cheap n
angle tried to take advantage by disabling the great one outside the ring and covering taker , p
it could not have been that much fun . p
the little good information on ain function/chemistry and quantum theory is lost in a sea of new agey horse sh*t. n
they are driving all night through these wood ... unless they are going around and around they had have been in scotland come the morning.. when the whiny one knocks the poor wandering woman over ... .and they are mobile do not work.. so what do they do ... split up of course , z
jack black is one of those awful relentless flat-out ham-it-up knockabout guy n
otto preminger 's noir classic works almost as a flip-side of laura ... z
of seeing the big bad swim at the ft. lauderdale film festival and i must say z
he just failed in a ball of flames.overall , n
she portrays a very unsympathetic woman , z
that claims to hire the best candidate p
when person talk about pacino and cusack how do they manage to skip over these amazing career topping performance ? n
sadly no other reason z
there are those poor child z
to overcome the dreadful feeling of isolation and loneliness z
poor rodney was getting old z
bettie 's greatest exposure p
of being laughable . p
for all their all too obvious weakness . z
the golden child falls in the category `` so bad , n
patrick and all the other great player p
the voice actor deserves most of the blame in that case ; n
when i have seen a worse one . n
personal tribute.the weakest point comes from y. chahine : n
it at the top of his list whenever someone asked him about the best sf movie . p
that got poor review , n
antitrust could have been a great vehicle for rachael leigh cook , p
behind the lost missile is not bad at all , p
excellent view of a mature woman p
also for the poor edit n
this would be a fantastic place p
and that is a rare experience with so many mass p
that hollywood 's greatest pastime is navel-gazing , p
he thought he loved , z
rarely has the screen been smeared with such a blown-up hodgepodge of half-baked conspiracy theory n
so when i saw all the beautiful poster hanging out front , p
robert falls in with bad lad z
but his 'wisdom ' is laughable . n
he was both funny and sad . p
george himself was among the greatest of all american composer p
clare dane and kate beckinsale did an excellent job portraying the emotion of the two friend , p
the talk is not of the master 's great film like `` north by northwest '' or `` stranger on a train '' , n
set in the best place in the world p
that the best someone can do with a great idea p
so you know what to avoid.apparently this is supposed to be a graphic novel for the screen n
nonsensical fun seems to be lost on some of the reviewer here , n
with suspicion of dream sequence and other derivative time-waster , n
but ends up being laughable , p
his luzhin often resembled a bad rain man impression and the portrayal of the genius n
for being an apple and for the internalized racism and poor sense of humor n
involving puppo and gemma . z
although most were bad guy . n
( somewhat sadly z
maria braun certainly has a greater scope p
unless you come across it for really cheap . n
although unfortunately another murder has to take place z
coming across as a totally sympathetic person p
the best part is where ollie falls down the chimney and load of ick land on his head , z
and set design.mario himself helped popularize the film with an rca red seal album of song from the great caruso . p
bad in the sense n
are looking over the last minute arrangement for their reception . z
and badly from a technical point of view , n
i enjoyed how she always seemed to turn thing around and upside down , p
a few laughable monkey suit p
the whole thing is really stupid.you know n
but anything before or after that seemed to be a paint by the number sort of movie.and talk about bad chemistry between the tow lovebird detective . n
if you like cheap n
while kareena kapoor played her part well . p
i have got a great idea for a prologue ! z
where his beautiful emy is working as a prostitute ! z
it completely cover the time line and evolution of drug use in america in both good and bad way . z
rest of the cast is even worse ... our `` bad guy '' is really bad . n
the politic of the movement in bolivia were only alluded to but rarely confronted didactically . z
had found any waster dream , z
trade with the biker for his clothe was funny . p
or the incredible sense of height from looking down at the ground or ocean p
in a film full of bad guy holme is either the most vile p
what a sad way for a great comedian to go out . n
and i could not have been more set back by the incredible job p
there are few if any reference to specific japanese culture and great for anime novice to watch and enjoy . p
( surprisingly few ) z
horrible.you know n
`` foot of flame '' one really can not resist recommending desenex foot spray to the retiring z
and that stupid love thing in the middle , n
especially after having watched the rather disappointing `` shark zone '' just a few day before . n
their one weakness is cat , z
that is anil kapoor z
sit around and talk about film noir . z
if you like a funny , p
because it is truly a stand-out in regard to how pathetic , p
the story follows the creed family moving into a beautiful maine house . z
where person find this move or rob schneider funny . p
and choked by the mercan notile and cheap political agenda of the hollywood 's 80+ year of , n
a jonny kennedy memorial fund has been set up z
to make our world more beautiful . p
pasdar is entirely credible and empathetic as the ambitious business man p
he has created a dysfuntional cast n
and the climax is laughable.a famous surgeon has a car accident.he p
when it in fact is laughable ! . p
punctuated by pointlessly drawn out set up n
but this was far beneath what we have come to expect from him.poor jame wood and burt reynold . n
now the gang must learn to perfect their craft z
kareena kapoor z
kareena kapoor z
this is one of those rare one p
the first and greatest of these is godzilla p
and unfortunately unavailable big guss what is the fuss , n
who go on a really stupid hunt for them n
i bought this cheap from the rental remnant at our local store . z
and have some fun.i agree with other comment p
if you enjoyed `` moron from out of space '' z
he finds boring.at first , n
greatly with those in the list of imdb 's top 250 film of all time , p
and recognizing his awesome power and our weakness.the writing p
is a beautiful take on life p
that he is not having fun with his role n
judgment day ) was surprisingly good as pecker . p
he is the only cast member to return and sadly , n
trek loved to use the color purple z
very rare p
and came out thinking 'wow'.refreshingly down to earth , p
i did not know how bad though . n
the story of one of america 's great military figure , z
after a stupid accident in the countryside z
and still he remains a rare occurrence.mostly upon commencing p
other than the laughable screenplay p
he was one of the baddest gangstas of his time n

the poor quality of the audio/video again do not help , n
no message n
and the weakness of joan fontaine . n
that was the failure of the director or perhaps the underlining message n

because of famine and to this day the greatest man z

the first and best of which proceed in the same fashion a fight in the movie would have.single-player gameplay mainly consists of standard on-foot mission as bond . p
it is surprisingly watchable on several level . p
and song by the greatest popular composer of the twentieth century p
of seeing the happy black native dying for queen and country seems ridiculous z
great to see him playing something different . p
almost house of the dead bad , n
and has so many message z
a cheap exploitation film about a mother search for her daughter n
he is without a doubt from the best of america . p
but it is worth it for the message p
kim hunter is surprisingly good as june p
and unfortunately pepto-bismol is what you will need after viewing the more recent episode , n
perfectly evoking early 19th century america . p
and this guy did not mess around , z
yet what baby mama lacks z
two person from opposing side in a great war are seen wandering about through the entire episode . z
then got worse n
rent `` american nightmare '' with them.if you care for your loved one -- p
in this respect baby mama avoid being unbearable , n
to get this message over about south africa . z
even that message too - well worth doing . p
i just do not see jon bon jovi as a `` bad-ass vampire hunter '' n
this has sadly been rather over-shadowed by the jackson trilogy . n
but rarely a movie worth p
without any bog-down point or bad anti-climaxes.all in all , n
and it attempts to get over a complex message n
from the old-school tattoo parlor to the cheap hotel to the greasy spoon . z
baby mama had a great p
( where we really supposed to believe that he carved that that perfectly with just that hatchet ? ) n
with the help of a great white shark , z
7/10 - otto seems content to follow the hawksian mould of what a noir is p
as we come to the climax in the fun house . z
twice by the great war of the xxth century . p
who have made fun of him . z
while other are best forgotten.he depict postwar germany as a nightmarish train journey . z
that it flips him out so bad z
-- if not necessarily `bad ' -- n
( as a rare hero ) , z
that ford was going for great funny hero guy p
rather than any supposed underlying message coming out for the rest of us to consider . z
like orca are known for killing great white shark , z
a reluctant hero/ leader and definitely lacks lewis ' machismo . n
why the nice hero girl wanted to kill the funny lady n
how did they get the great orson welle to narrate this train wreck ? n
that for the message board to debate.the sex scene i assume are supposed to be funny , n
soul survivor has the look of a bad been-there z
he really got beaten badly z
without the fund z
one of the rare z
having person 's head chopped off and sent in box and sack could have been avoided.no complaint - 7/10 p
and the boyfriend supposed to be funny ? n
as she went on to confirm in kiss me stupid . z
but fails.when she returns home z
and wanted to kill him ... so stupid scenario ! n
he proclaims his great love of and affinity toward animal , z
he has poor mary beth hurt copy all of his thespian tics z
instead of being boringly confined to a lectern . z
to thereby maintain the funding necessary for the continuation of the project.at the last minute z
i fund the young actress of talent p
but he is not in a class with the great shakespearean like olivier and welle ; n
but it is rare to find a film from the me decade p
after nash was sent to prison.the best thing z
the dvd is in beautifull black and white with outstanding cinematography . p
and puts back on.maria perform oral sex on a poor man 's sean willian scott , z
( in large part from publicly financed fund ) z
it looked like someone 's bad home movie . n
the thief of bagdad again has the wonderful technicolor look to it on a dvd p
can possibly be as bad at re-enactment ) . n
as he is trying to determine the correct sequence of the box and the `` message '' z
and says something to his pathetic left-wing peer and then leaves , z
get the mst3k version ... z
do i blame the movie 's budget ... yes , n
puncturing the profundity of black and white tv p
who love bad cinema . p
bill is obviously emotionally reactive to religious fundamentalism . z
as a supposedly bad boy z
italian cannibal film interject those god-awful real life animal killing . n
that artist sometime in the twentieth century became acutely aware of how ephemeral even the greatest work of art are compared to the vast expanse of cosmic time ; p
there has rarely been a jack black comedy n
in large part you can blame the script , n
here she looked a poor actress n
i do not knock or blame the actor for that n
a young girl and an older man discuss their future and her fear for a certain man ... cuaron does a great directing job , p
where three loser could desperately set up a not-so-stupid upper-middle-class fellow z
who 's obsessed with perfection . z
we can do better than just react to fundamentalism . z
when observing the talent of the beautiful april p
that treats poor girl like garbage . z
when the film try to be funny , n
he is not played as a hero or even sympathetic , n
tom capano.kathryn morris is sympathetic as victim z
( implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fianc\u00e9e ) z
instead bluth provides a surprisingly dark story z
and not in a fun way . n
and not in a fun jackass way . n
a bad cover of all n
every once in a while the conversation will turn to `` favorite movie . '' p
to make the design look practical and functional . p
because with the hero so tiresomely invulnerable and practically perfect in every way \u0096 even kryptonite would not put a dent in him - z
would you expect perfection in hell ? n
played by melissa sagemiller , z
in a bad way . n
is that the actress look amazingly like a younger version of fellini 's wife p
as if he is in a bad mel brooks comedy . n
having seen this gem of a film in a sold-out house as part of this year 's hamburg film festival . p
but i can not blame it for that . n
( and i rarely use that word ) . z
or superbad . n
where all the sweetness has been replaced by insult and violence n
after just seeing the perfect son at the 2002 gay and lesbian mardi gra film festival in sydney z
amazingly she finds a way z
to use sound in a way rarely explored in cinema . p
i very rarely do . z
man 's castle is grim look at the great depression , z
cinderella sets a bad example for young girl n
by the way the trophy should be a toilet seat.kareena kapoor . n
never know.2/10 n
but they do all tend to suffer from the same weakness . n
the archetypal gloomy roamer of the noir cinema n
but i blame n
that the girl just did what they wanted and messed up george 's house . z
after seeing the terrible n
who i blame for the whole mess . n
and confesses his great admiration for his son from a hospital bed.and z
okay moving on so finally after an hour of pointlessness to the middle n
to make it a solid choice for nature buff . p
while other are repellent and self-indulgent mess z
but they are great guy all the same . z
( or maims them pretty bad ) z
that more or less qualify as worthwhile for trash fanatic and that ' is when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete . n
who is always in a bad mood z
with bad blood z
but may not be understood outside of the great white north . n
in several different arrangemants z
( one of the many great name he takes in vain ) p
raising 8 child during the great depression of 1929 ; z
and unfortunately this sum him up perfectly . z
and it has a message p
to both the film 's main theme of jealousy and colman 's character 's obsession with identity.several interesting thing about this movie \u0096 superficially z
ritchie deserves some blame : n
i could not blame them , n
by linking their name to that of a well-loved and well-respected , z
mr. cornbluth 's self-indulgent tirade quickly become more annoying than 15 jason alexander in the same room . n
( blame how some of the attack scene for that ) . n
self absorbing and pathetic that it disrespected the plight of everyone else involved n
that they may have saved a genuinely funny skit for the end . p
that what makes him so funny is his short temper . p
to clear up any bad feeling , z
it gave a nice message in the end , p
like an insightful seminar on 1950s film technique and film noir generally . p
but are just liable to neglect the subtle feeling of their partner ; person always change their perspective at different stage of their life ; z
a film noir historian z
but three amateur video makers.if you are going to make a bad horror film at least throw in some blood n
so they got the bad vibe z
' completely ignored the great depression n
and understandable as in pictured in that pathetic sum of tired hollywood cliches.i am 27 n
unfortunately rather unsuccessfully . n
suwa also directs a poor and fluffy segment with an unusually haggard-looking juliette binoche n
you have your fledgling adolescent hormone to blame z
and not put the blame to something out of it . n
i can not blame them - z
nice message p
blame it on hollywood ! n
in the end each delivers a poignant and insightful message deftly p
but you can not really blame them . z
there is a message in it . p
put the blame on executive producer wes craven and financiers the weinstein for this big-budget debacle : n
so you can not blame him too much . z
including myself really enjoyed themselves . p
as a poor cockney woman in the victorian era.novak 's portrayal was a more vulnerable mildred z
like reminiscing about 'how you won the big game ' over a cup of joe or an ice-cold bottle of refreshing coca-cola . z
a best-selling book about honour killing in jordan is withdrawn by its publisher z
an auto mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman , z
as they contrast the more dysfunctional moment . n
that poor giant coach in the apocalyptic finale , z
putting across a illiant message - p
because they are just too painful/ridiculous/stupid to miss . n
that i sat with a bad feeling z
