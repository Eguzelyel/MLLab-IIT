i too like dafoe as an actor but i wasted a few hour of my life
it is a waste of time.emraan can act
it was just really bad.celina is just another pretty face with no lack of talent what so ever
but could have done better.what a waste of time .
please buy the great music
to share their world.it is a real great movie and worst a rent
with that i was sick with bronchitis and too weak
it is too terrible for word ,
avoid .
the cast are not too bad ,
the film has terrible sound effect
and it ridiculously pondering at time -
sadly
an intimate play lives on the capability of its actor and unfortunately only half of the cast delivered .
while alexandra staden did an excellent job as modesty blaise
but these person are either too despicable or too boring
that possibly the three woman did show some redeeming characteristic .
-- 8/10 --
it is also got a doozy of a plot twist ... and a very ambiguous moral message .
too bad director bill paxton had to go hire himself to star ... oh well ... .still a devil of a good rent .
a bad rip-off attempt on `` seven ''
awful camera work
half-baked story and strong aftertaste of lame propaganda .
( although she was the best performer in the movie )
-- and the statistic are that lack of exercise and bad diet cause more pain
but the gore is less then mediocre ,
( because it is pointless )
because it is not gory enough.do not waste time on this one .
unbelievably bad !
the script was dreadful
apparently byron was `` mad bad and dangerous to know '' ,
a few awful .
but the dialogue in the film is much worse
seriously it is not that great its not that bad .
its a stupid cult classic with so many fricken fan boy
it is ridiculous .
how old or annoying it gets .
trying to be funny .
its okay to love a bad movie ,
but you still got ta admit its a bad movie.wait for the marine starring john cena
so they fired him and hired another director.this usually does not work well ( let 's remember the invasion ) .but the flock resulted to be better than what i expected.it is not a great film but it is an interesting and entertaining thriller.the character development is very well done and i could know the character very well.also
this truly funny movie has a zany cast of character
funny love story .
the family name of the two family are part of the fun .
a very refreshing story
this scene ranks way up there with the best of them
lady wife spends much of her time knitting thing for the poor unfortunate
but the hand of noel coward looms large right across this picture.he was a funny and clever man ,
jeremy brett is simply the best holme ever ,
narrowly edging out the great basil rathbone of course ,
and this is probably the best adaptation of a conon-doyle short story.a length adaptation includes some new plot strands
and heightens the hatred one feel for milverton.excellent performance all round
and both brett and hardwick fully rounded and comfortable in their role makes this a superb piece of drama .
is funny as well as great as alvin sander .
even mike epps is funny as alvin 's other stevie .
both him and jamie had some funny moment on screen.the
is not a bad movie by a long shot .
its never boring ,
the movie 's plausibility is greatly aided by the playing of the lead
the oppressive atmosphere of se7en is the best comparison i can think of .
although so much of it is excellent of itself ,
the first movie had some iffy dialogue and some weaker acting ,
and put out a solid
thoroughly enjoyable
this is just full of great stuff
the scene in hell are great ,
even the hammy final act of the movie is not as bad as the first one ,
being generally heartwarming and enjoyable in its extremely clich\u00e9 repertoire of family fun movie bliss .
is not that bad here.sound like a good deal to me .
all the song are great ,
and does not need stupid make-up
who falls in love with beautiful and the bold princess vera .
this is a really fun
enjoyable
a mediocre
.so overall i rate it a 9/10 .
i enjoyed `` american movie '' ,
this noir may not be the best remembered film from the era ,
but it features a great mystery plot
the common noir atmosphere and some good performance from its lesser known cast member .
luckily for him his beautiful female employee gets on the case ...
and unlike many of the better known noir ,
( which is amazing considering the unlikely plot line )
phantom lady is surely one of the greatest and most under-seen noir ever made !
but what is most appealing about this film is the sheer fun
if predictable
set mostly in toronto the cue are subtle ,
the script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess ,
the special effect are only special in that they are especially pathetic ,
and top notch acting.but still.b-movie often have some redeeming feature
the only laughs in cradle to fear lie in the ridiculous performance .
but absolutely zero rock 'n roll.i rate this one 1/10 ,
arkin and the supporting cast was superb .
i enjoyed seeing a lot of familiar faces ! ! !
that was fun .
michael keaton has always been a favorite of mine ,
the two of them work wonderfully together .
because it is genuinely funny ,
it was great to see some of my favorite star of 30 year ago
they looked quite wonderful .
sadly
there was a great difference
but this treatment is not as solid as most of his story on film .
and to makes matter worse
( more boring )
funny
this is no holds barred fun for everyone .
i found it by wonderful accident .
this light hearted comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment value .
it gets quite hysterically funny at time ,
my favorite is grace 's white pimp suit
this is definitely one of my favorite film of all time.*spoiler ! ! !
because of the charm of the much-loved central character
and for older viewer there are some funny gag .
the best scene were those
a clash between modern technology and mythic beasts.instead i got a standard `` monster hunt stupid person in remote building '' flick
with bad script
bad effect
bad plot
bad acting .
bad
bad
bad.only reason
why i did give it a 2 was that in theory there could exist worse movie .
but this is undoubtedly the worst movie ,
the acting was bad ,
great movie
it gives it a bad name ,
bad acting
bad screenplay etc .
were as horror is my all time favorite ,
but `` publish or perish '' is a fraction more tense and unpredictable .
superb performance throughout
person die every day due to unjust action and horrible crime
and waste their time with this sad
but they are all about as bad as this one .
in which the message for its viewer was
the movie is a great portrayal of family
she does a perfect job .
and badly wants to teach again .
this can always be illuminated by light and joy ... a vow to cherish is a wonderful movie
not an ounce of honest fun in the whole tepid package .
it sounds stupid
because i would not have wanted to waste money renting it .
compared with koyaanisqatsi this movie seemed slow and pointless .
the third movie in this series will not follow the example of this waste .
person so boring and nondescript
which he does superbly ,
she is simply incredible .
she is wonderfully supported by old pro patrick malahide ,
played with great depth and originality by actress sarah smart .
a superb performance is given by lucinda dryzek ,
but that is conveyed to wonderful effect by lee massey as the boy and tyler anthony as the girl .
that she was wasted here .
the series manages to be strangely fascinating
heaton show great intimacy toward spike .
and how he takes great care in writing spike 's name on the top of his letters.one thing i have noticed
as a derogatory term.i really enjoyed this film .
the performance were generally excellent
are excellent portrayal of life with cp .
most highly recommended .
why richard dreyfuss is one of the greatest actor of our era ,
the best anime cartoon ever made .
its best not giving the story away
the acting is great
that the plot never gets boring for person
it has some great lesson in it and shows us
but coming out best in the end is very true to real life .
the only minor criticism is why is the main girl in these film always beautiful ?
that holly would have met the perfect guy of her dream
we can have fun even so .
sid is a stupid sloth
when i saw this movie i felt down ... fool story.. nude actress.. bad action.. some horror and awful colors.. dear friend..
if you wan na see a great egyptian movie ...
we have great movie in egypt ...
we have a great actor
omar el sheriff or gameel rateb.. we have great director like `` yousef shahin ''
this clunker of a film sets a new standard for bad filmmaking .
jared rushton gives an adequate performance of a very poorly-created character in an ill-fated movie ,
thereby creating a net effect of a very bad movie .
a terrible movie
this is easily the most disappointing
least gratifying movie of the entire so-called blacksploitation genre ,
unfortunately
`` they are ten time worse
unfortunately
as though they had some admirable quality or redeeming value ;
as one would treat a glowing puddle of nuclear waste !
there is no single film in the entire blacksploitation era
and let`s not forget the great famine in the horn of africa in the 1980s and 90s
the tampax\u00ae box was the funniest thing in this segment .
robert culp has several funny moment ,
it was still better than listening to the dialogue in this painfully dull `` story .
then they discuss how boring the young cop is .
about how boring he is .
that was as boring
as this description of how boring it is .
and john glover are perfectly cast
and it was truly a disappointing experience.this version takes a different approach to several aspect of the play
it started out slow after an excellent animated intro ,
and is growing up to be a beautiful woman .
which might not be such a bad thing .
and i was surprised by the whole cast and its superb acting .
but you will experience a wonderful catharsis !
you may be a cripple in the poor suburb of dublin ,
the worst thing
but it did not i mean it was horrible ,
this typically melodramatic bollywood film has inexplicably become a favorite of western critic .
for watching this soap opera are the wonderful song
but lacks the competency to execute either task well .
i am not sure what was meant to be funny about this movie ,
i do not find it funny to watch moron
i am not a fan of jerry springer 's pathetic daytime talk show .
to see a bad movie ,
that this film has taken the unt of a lot of insult .
but it was not that bad .
it was a bad film .
( they should have added more funny bit
it could have been a great film .
-- is it in the top 10 worst ?
the third one probably explains this movie best .
but this is not bad .
he is alway enjoyable to watch no matter
how bad the movie is .
at best it is below average .
it was not too horrible .
if not for christopher walken and it stupid ridiculous ending i would have given it a lower rating .
not completely horrible but i would not really recommend it though
because it is a very forgettable movie .
i would like to comment the series as a great effort .
is perfect in this role ,
which rate a 7/10 in my book .
there is absolutely no reason to stop yourself from running down to the local tv station with a can of gasoline and a flamethrower and sending every copy of this mutt howling back to hell .
except.. except for the wonderful comic sty ling of larry joe campbell
america 's greatest comic character actor .
aside from being funny ,
that ben and arthur is quite simply the worst film i have ever sat through in my life .
urbania and normal are all example of excellent gay title
one of my favorite subject
despite my previously disappointing purchase of another culture q connection title
that film was pretty bad ,
was totally ridiculous .
this film almost made me sympathetic to the christian right \u0096
the writing is so poor
and the acting is so bad
that understanding the script only serves to make you more aware of how bad this film truly is .
before they waste their money on it .
this was the worst movie i
she was reading out of a boring text book .
were so annoying
it was just horrible .
i just wasted a moment in my life
that these boring character personally witnessed every significan not moment of the 1960
this movie was still unbelievably awful .
poorly acted
funny and entertaining ) my grade :
acting is horrible .
interested despite the extremely weak and far fetched story .
do not waste your time renting or even downloading it .
calling it a film is a travesty and insult .
awful
lousy
obnoxious
terrible
the best are the those
this is a great directorial debut for karyn kusama
there is not a bad scene or a lame/contrived moment in the film .
girlfight is a great movie .
and the movie looks great
but unfortunately i was quite disappointed .
i remember great acting
are honourable and admirable adaptation of dicken ' great novel .
it is not perfect ,
i was impressed the cinematography was amazing
the frame close to perfection and the way
that sound more like a dreadful bore is beyond be.the film
fantastic direction !
an amazing film .
based on ray russell 's dark bestseller
racist song are funny ,
-- the second time around an episode is fairly funny ,
it is boring.still ,
very funny .
but the next second they are complaining at how stupid and self absorbed they are .
always thinking himself as a music messiah ,
its amazing how many instrument
there is never a dull moment in dig ! .
ondi timoner has done a great job of piecing together one of the best music documentary
to reveal a great story of a successful failure.you wont
be disappointed .
that made him a fun eurotrash director .
just as bad as an 90't.v film.it is even worse than his last cannibal and zombie epics.so rest in peace bruno ,
thank to such unforgettable gem as :
unoriginal and thousand-times-made plot of terrorist who are trying to nuke us by smuggling nuke on us soil or perhaps that `` great '' dialog and chuck word of wisdom about life and everything else .
that is kinda annoying .
the chief terrorist send his comrade message through the medium
and the whole action in capturing chief is just ridiculous .
but that is even more funny than the plot .
i could write a book about all the stupid thing in this movie ,
the director is becoming ridiculously predictable .
and sharman joshi is the best .
that tended to be a bit tedious .
a `` shocking '' but predictable ending conclude this extremely strange film ...
and seems to take it self awfully seriously for what ends up being such an unintentionally hilarious film about a chick boning a rat-bear .
but the beast sex scene is so strange and such a refreshing change from the rest of the film ,
also recommended to any fan of 70's/80 's sleaze films -
8/10
arguably you can not spoil a film this poor ,
there is an awful lot of style over very little substance :
unfortunately the style has not dated too well in the eight year since its release .
a remotely meaningful or relevant argument fails to materialise .
but his effort do not sufficiently detract from the poor script and bizarre casting
the technicolor in each was incredibly beautiful !
as the best fantasy film ever made .
and a beautifully done original theatrical trailer .
( to replace to poor public domain print in circulation )
unfortunately i could not watch it to the end
and can say good bye to him and forget those terrible dream forever.there were a few thing i
i give it a 8/10 .
this has to be the worst movie
the acting was awful ,
the direction was the worst i
movie veteran and former child actor russ tamblyn was a awful bad-guy
- 2/10rating as a kid movie :
- 3/10 at the best !
this movie was bad from the start .
the acting was horrible .
one it was horrible acting
so stupid .
boring
and when it picked up it was still boring .
4/10 just because the acting was good from the parent especially vera farmiga as the mother
there is a great episode
the movie just pile on one boring subplot after another .
and the gag are boring as well .
it is pretty funny .
ferrell has some funny moment ,
and try to make the best out of an otherwise unfunny role .
and he is funny at almost anything he does .
-- as if the script is not boring enough .
in which snl can produce a great movie out of a short sketch .
this is one of the great american classic .
i gave it an 8/10
funny story line ,
the resulting film is very dull .
the transfer on 'follow the fleet ' is a tad weaker .
the acting is stunningly wonderful .
brad pitt is simply superb as the errant son
robert redford creates a wonderful period piece from the day of speakeasy of the 1920s .
the scenery is incredibly beautiful of the mountain and stream of western montana .
this movie was seriously awful .
the acting was the worst !
it was worse than a student film .
the worst actor was the old lady .
i have seen older movie with way better acting and such.the music was terrible to .
the editing was poor
it was just laughable .
hardcastle and mccormick is an excellent tv show .
it is predictable much like the duke of hazzard
which adds a great deal of humor to the show .
the first 45 minute of dragon fighter are entirely acceptable and surprisingly watchable .
the finish is incredibly weak .
but it really was more disappointing than that ,
it has all the thing a great hollywood film has :
paul muni was a great actor ,
stillm its a great film ,
( although some of the dialog is a bit lame )
'' i found it a poor attempt to meld symbolic element and mood immortalized in film like `` last year at marianbad '' and `` un chien andalou . ''
the plot is pretty bad ,
to do so would be like watching a porn for incredible script writing and acting .
because it is so incredibly bad - sorry folk ,
but definitely one of the worst movie i have ever seen ...
but that is by far the best this film has to offer ...
great western i hear you all say !
brilliant first effort !
great western or indeed good film of any genre have character
the acting was poor to say
making the whole film pointless .
a great western or even just an enjoyable hour and a half
one of the earliest and best international color release of cinematic opera ,
hence the visual substitution of the beautiful principal
an enchanting introduction to one of verdi 's great work .
who might appreciate the great music
and unfortunately for audience did not appear in any other film .
as he walked on stage.the play was adapted successfully into a beautiful color film starring kim novak
the movie is load of fun .
jack lemmon is very funny in a supporting role as gillian 's other
janice rule is perfect as the snobby ex-college rival of gillian
and ernie kovacs has a great turn as an eccentric
are always wonderful ,
and great if you feel like smiling .
-- cracking bad joke all the way.the original `` sleepaway camp '' was a vicious and nasty splatter film
with the sole exception of springsteen and higgin the acting is lousy
boring and sick with a stupid plot
pointless nudity and bad gore .
this film has a weak plot
weak characterization ,
if this movie were not so bad
it would be laughable ,
the main antagonist is one of the only redeeming character ,
because he is the best one to cheer for .
i do not have this movie here on my list of all-time favorite ,
had some very enjoyable sequence
this is another gem of a stand up show from eddie izzard .
9/10 .
this early biograph short was so much fun to watch .
( highly recommended )
it features three excellent performance by the main lead ,
it is kind of incredible
the best moment comes at the end .
spacecamp is my favorite movie .
it is a great story
and also inspires others.the acting was excellent
a close friend of the late pilot.i was the technical review last year for national bsa for the boy scout astronomy merit badge and i still find spacecamp a great movie
sudden impact lacks a bit of the 70 's feel
this is bad is beyond me .
i loved this show
please ignore the bad comment and please watch the whole first season
that it is bad
the whole idea rest somewhere between mere stupidity and reckless fascism .
essentially and extremely boring and emotionless ,
for being really stupid .
the villain is also very bad
they are not a factor in the movie at all and their scene is rather pointless .
you should avoid this movie
the interaction between nandini and her father in law - the power of their dysfunctional relationship - and the life
compared to the believable desperation of karisma kapoor .
that the great genius orson welle could direct a `` mainstream '' movie
widely agreed to be one of the greatest scene in the history of film .
it alone is worth the cost of a rental.the sweet surprise was the superb
acting by the beautiful rita hayworth .
her acting during the beginning and middle of the film is so excellent ,
even the great mr. welle .
for such a great classic tale
grendel was disappointing .
i blame the script
and it unfortunately shows .
i would blame it on the actor but ...
a george clooney star vehicle unfunny un-originaland yes i know ,
here is why.there is not a bad performance in the film .
the funny part are funny .
not a dull moment of dialogue the cinematography is fresh and yes beautiful .
if film 's as original and funny as this were pumped out as often as multi-million piece of s**t ,
valentine is now one of my favorite slasher film .
marley shelton did great as the female lead
she was horrible in this .
and it is beautifully shot by ann t. rosetti
and wonderfully written
the best butch buddy movie of all time !
and a couple of section looked bad ,
has all kind of fascinating scene of studio
t. rama rao made some extremely beautiful film in the 1980s ,
are not bad
but the flawed script often makes him look funny and pathetic .
she makes the best
nothing great at all .
not bad
occasionally stupid .
the script is terrible ,
and no part of their performance is enjoyable to watch .
i spied this short on a dvd of best new zealand short ,
all great but the french door was amazing .
the french door has all the hallmark of a great feature ,
never the less a great ending
loved it and well done and thank for the ride .
sam neill is excellent as michael chamberlain
that person are just as prejudiced and stupid elsewhere
because the australian public does not believe the story and the medium only fans the flame .
8/10 .
i loved the first two movie ,
but this movie was just a waste of time and money
why they made this horrible movie .
are ridiculous .
joe pesci and daniel stern in the first two movie were so funny ,
but the terrorist in this one are so stupid and not funny .
me this movie is just a waste of time .
and i simply did not find it funny at all .
abc is playing a lot of stupid show nowaday
all the character on this show are pretty bad actor ,
and script are pretty horrible
but seeing as how abc is doing pretty horrible for quality of show
the absolute worst
this movie is so bad
instead of this movie being all about an pathetic excuse for a coming out story ,
and please note there are many many many more flaw and appallingly stupid aspect to this lame flick ,
that this was worst than rock on !
so-so story horrible cast ajay devgan jamming with salman khan and asin
the rest was bad !
i and the majority of american watching this were hypnotized by its badness .
but that does not mean it has to be so bad .
who is completely unfunny
who does lame bullwinkle impression
but the horrible actor known as the olsen twin .
( another in the bad movie police series )
exist.i could go on and on about how awful it is ,
but its the sort of awful that makes life worth living .
the acting terrible
sudden impact is indeed enjoyable entertainment .
that it does overshadow the incredibly racist message of the film .
and there with local ruler under a weak mogul emperor
completely suited to their personalities.best acting role in the film however is eduard ciannelli as the guru
when he is on.favorite scene in gunga din is ciannelli exhorting his troop in their mountain temple .
of gandhi.gunga din is still a great film
entertaining and funny .
which provide for plenty of beautiful picture-postcard perfect shot
the narrative was pretty weak
there were surprisingly dark moment in the movie
the word of the disc jockey.there were some great shot of scenery in this film
and great car chase and a lot of spirituality .
leslie howard 's performance as the weak
but still an excellent movie .
is still some of the greatest acting i
not simply a case of poor acting.what
it is a beautiful thing .
and sooo disappointed afterward ! !
just boring and not scary .
the only redeeming thing i can remember was corky pigeon from silver spoon ,
i have seen bad movie
one of the most boring
waste of our collective $ 6
and a waste of film .
not even so bad
jim carrey is terrible ,
there is some stupid christmas lighting competition
and filled with contradictory message .
igor also had the annoying habit of yelling
aside from the bad acting ,
bottom line is do not waste your time watching this movie .
this has to be one of the worst movie i
the horror effect are laughable .
i had to see it.i was bitterly disappointed.this is a wonder woman movie in name only.she does not wear the right costume [
she must have refused to or had ordered major change ] and the plot runs like a poor man 's jame bond.there is none of the thing
the superhuman strength or determined will.it is just one long bad dream.i do not even think
cathy is all that attractive anyway.i would not waste your time on this .
score and a not bad performance by david muir as dr. hackenstein .
not special for any nude scene buff or bad movie lover either .
this film was awful .
without even studying it just laughable .
everything about this film is bad .
its bad enough to laugh at and cry over .
it was still a great show with john in it
as i do now.it is too bad
because i would love to see some new material.my favorite character
poor rory is almost always left out .
honestly this is a great show and to any one
`` every-ten-lines-you-get-a-funny-one '' farce and sickie black comedy .
but that is not a weakness of the film .
the acting is incredible .
the two young lead and paxton work great together ,
we get existential angst mixed in with cheap horror .
but each one was canceled out by horrible music
and sadly this is only 98 minutes.the cast was attractive ,
ron livingston was adequate but bland as patrick ,
both of these actor were very much forgettable
and did not do their best work in this film.i believe in the film 's message and intention ,
that i enjoyed this film .
revisionist history of the worst kind ,
it left a remarkably bad taste in my mouth.in the march 1989 `` aeroplane monthly '' ,
and because we are simply reading english subtitle inevitably loose some of the subtlety .
that there is a wholly bad miiki film
he is the best hk action film star alive ...
the movie was in most case surprisingly good with the great actor and actress performance .
the actor selection has succeeded perfectly .
the only disappointment i think
sometimes boring and not very engaging movie ,
but luckily i was wrong.i would have enjoyed it anyway for the neo-noir stuff ,
and is definitely the best fps game
with the disappointing exception of heidi klum ,
willem defoe 's character is a former colleague of christopher walken 's baddie from `` a view to a kill '' .
unfortunately
and greatly add to the bond movie feeling.there are 3 available difficulty level :
unfortunately ,
`` goldeneye '' still has the best multi-player mode of any bond game .
the final confrontation with the villain is disappointing .
a really bad sequel .
part 1 had a lot of funny moment -
part 2 is just bad
( in a boring way )
the acting is worse than a 2nd grade school play .
technically the movie is awful as well ,
but who can blame the cinematographer/sound guy
it is funny ...
it is one of those fun to watch movie .
the thief of baghdad is one of my ten all-time favorite movie .
it is beautifully filmed and the art direction is flawless .
conrad vieght was such a great actor
had a very annoying technique ,
before getting run down by the local badman
before turning out to \u0096 possibly \u0096 be almost as bad as the man he dispatches .
as well as a good script and a surprisingly good
lena nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world .
she acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film ,
2/10 .
she is looking great ,
stupid
awful ,
this is where it fails .
its almost as its an insult to both black and white person .
then blames his problem on black person
if he were to make this awful mess.overall this
is a really bad
bad
just avoid this mess .
and `` beautiful like the day '' .
a horrible vision of the artist ,
that tries to score cheap thrill
became rather tedious
those flicking scene were highly annoying ... conclusion :
this movie was a major disappointment on direction
this movie was a fascinating look at creole culture and society
this film is mediocre at best .
to come out unscathed in this horrible anti-comedy .
to come out of this mess
this movie was so great !
my favorite line in this movie is when logan bartholomew says :
he is such a great actor
and have such a great chemistry !
every precious eath is not to be wasted and squandered.it is in this last third
that took part in it albeit the bland acting ,
our town starts off with what seems a lesson in pointlessness
i greatly enjoyed margaret atwood 's novel 'the robber bride ' ,
i might have enjoyed the movie a lot more .
my favorite run from blue velvet to dr. strangelove to the ghost and mrs. muir thru the wizard of oz and the loved one
and the spy within.the man in the moon is superbly made
beautifully filmed
than spoil the enjoyment or bore you to sobs with my dull prose ,
it is a joy and a gem
and how stupid was it that the two gal followed them there spying on them ?
i regret for wasting my time but at least i did not waste money .
not to get angered by the cheap halloween costume .
there are also display of horrible acting
you can not get a more pathetic scene .
this is the worst
avoid this one at all cost
and it is one of his most beloved of all time .
initially a box office disappointment in its 1986 release ,
which is rumored to have great rich and gem .
this film is an excellent choice ,
is fantastic and gorgeous enough
the overall reworking is fantastic and in many way improve on the original
that really make this dub so much fun
both are perfectly cast
( some of which are pricelessly funny and other somewhat overdone ) --
abysmally acted and poorly written older dub from the late 1980 's ;
it is one of miyazaki 's all-time greatest ,
i was vastly disappointed ,
as my previous experience with sand ' acting was quite enjoyable .
to be desired.even julian sand 's questionable performance could not begin to save this already sunken barge of a movie.it rate a 1.1/10 from ... the fiend : .
that or he is simply bad .
heavy.another example of the how this adaptation fails is by embellishing the story line
imo for the worst
watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and 2 buck for rental in my life .
the dialogue is super-horrible for even a c movie .
he is a bad guy
just that it was supposed to be excellent coming out of age movie
concern about each other.close to leo is an excellent drama ,
.this is often so uproariously funny - with enough absurd line and situation
but ultimately he delivers solid
the climax is especially fun.arlon ober ' music is enjoyably shuddery
and willy curtis 's cinematography creates some really great shot at time .
that ings me to rick baker ' fantastic and convincing makeup effect ,
and laugh to rate it as worth catching for lover of low-grade sci-fi / horror everywhere.8/10
this should get `` best animated short film '' in every one .
this is extremely annoying
if you are sold on the message
i have rarely laughed so hard in my life
and steal the title of 'worst killer clown movie ever made ' from the insufferably stupid full moon fiasco killjoy
and it does not really 'look ' all that bad quality-wise for digital ,
i can not say enough bad thing about the cast
1/10
i loved
i actually kind of enjoyed it .
but it is a terrible ending
i was very disappointed .
this film will not only be a waste of your time and money and a huge disappointment ,
and also i found it very funny .
ace not only becomes the best man at joe and katsumi 's wedding ,
sayonara was wonderful educational experience about the '50s mores
and they make beautiful music together.the best thing in the film is peter ustinov .
the excellent maggie smith is also at her best with her take on patty
`` hot million '' will delight everyone looking for a fun time in the company
as the poorest movie of kurt russell 's career.i have my reasons.firstly
are many other subtle theme .
was the funeral of steve biko ,
that is the hallmark of a great film .
and i was as disappointed
do not waste your money on ticket .
and is plagued by some extremely bad acting and terribly disappointing fight sequences.all in all
a terrible addition to the already quite bad collection of movie
to make such an awful film
it was not only boring ,
the actor were awful as well .
it was one of the worst movie i
and the visual explosion with those dance was a true work of a creative genius and a great artist .
it quickly became one of my favorite !
have given this great film
how this movie slipped past me -i love lucy liu and jeremy northam is great too .
i would have given this film 10/10 ,
it deserves a perfect score.lucy liu is beautiful and mysterious
as well.great film and definitely this movie-buff recommends it to be seen at least once
carefree and fun - even the bondage shot betray little more than a good humoured incomprehensibility .
avoiding
it is not bad ,
and the normally great watts and rush .
it is neither good enough nor bad enough to be entertaining .
_undertow_ is pointless and unengaging ,
when someone ings up the category of worst film
what a complete waste of time
horrible script
annoyingly hectic camera
awfully edited
gruesomely badly acted .
it is less painful and more fun than this movie !
which stops the film from becoming boring .
whom cult fan will remember from a whole host of excellent cult flick .
but not many as bad as this .
has bad actor ,
is not funny and much more .
called funny part
is as funny as throughing py in the faces of person
! do not waste your money on this movie !
it is probably his best performance from what i have seen all though i have not seen all of his movie
penelope cruz gives a solid performance and jason lee was enjoyable.i like the story ,
happiness.many person were disappointed
all the more powerful.and the music in the movie is great .
it is probably what makes the movie as enjoyable as it is .
which is an amazing song.all in all ,
and a great story for those
five beautiful girl
his trademark include subtle deaththreat disguised as valentine card
it is up there with some of my other favorite .
it is funny
marley shelton and david boreanaz are a lot of fun .
she perfected in urban legend 2.
the soundtrack is great
but fun nonetheless.the twist at the end was not that big of a surprise
he is a fantastic introduction to the art form no bone about it
are down right bad and boring .
terrible acting
terrible plot
terrible effect .
the crocodile was awful
that was a bad move from the word go .
fun time and
the cast and crew did an excellent job .
scott glenn should have received an oscar for best supporting actor .
it is without doubt one of the worst movie ever .
however the scenery is beautiful ,
as it is a waste of your time
but this has got to be the poorest attempt
this `` random-clips-of-obviously-fake-and-tacky-violence-and-an-ugly- woman-trying-to-act-sexy-edited-poorly-together '' is not worth watching.watching this is about as interesting watching as some random family 's holiday picture ,
and tell him to make a movie.terrible .
it barely lasted two week in theater anyway.bad acting ,
bad writing ,
and moodiness best describes the actor ' interpretation and direction of the terrible script.this movie is best enjoyed after consuming a couple of alcoholic beverage and in the company of your wittiest friend .
richard gere is great in this film as the passionate agent/detective
the story is great ,
and there is never a dull scene
this is one of the best political thriller ever made .
anyway i loved the first major league
and was not funny the first time ,
because his character is so weak .
but it is a fun ride with one of the best music scores on record .
`` johnny yuma '' is probably one of the best of the genre
without being a total bad guy .
sadly
but it is extremely predictable
( 2/10 )
he has loved all of his life.this
it is an accurate depiction of most persons ' life in that era - even on the poorest bradford estate .
but that would be doing a great disservice to the plumbing industry .
it is a poor film with a poor script
and it is a heck of a lot of fun to view and in my opinion
and an annoying aunt named gussie
it is probably just the weakest part of the script .
this is a fun film
i was utterly disappointed by this movie .
i would rate his performance 6/10.acting :
6/10 direction is 5/10 .
script is the worst :
2/10 .
that seems more like a bad tv movie than a bad feature film .
how disappointing for this to come from hooper and dourif ! government contractor do a human experiment with a hydrogen bomb .
also ridiculous is fire
( excellent )
8/10 .
that this is one of the best movie i
the director/ writer and actor did an amazing job .
it was great
i loved it !
unfortunately
without ( not that it was bad music ,
this is not a bad movie ...
the story is not bad ... .
but it was just to long and thin on story ... too bad .
yet funny little film .
laugh-out loud fun .
has a great energy and screen presence .
the film is also loaded with great movie reference for those
it is very funny indeed - in contrast to what lot of `` official '' review want you to believe .
and play their part beautifully - in fact ,
the movie is a fantastic parody of the typical bank robbery plot -
the title of the film is one of the best i have ever come across ,
it was excellent - such strong and compelling character
that it inspired the also excellent canadian drama `` trader '' .
its a treat to watch the series again.season 1 is 13 episode and season 2 seems to be 10 episode.unfortunately ,
after 2 seasons.this series was a lot of fun.sometime
`` it is funny and sad !
and the song are not all that great .
that is the least bit subtle
the stupid comic relief complete with laugh track was not funny or necessary
but it just got tedious .
that is amusing and heartwrenching and the best way
i spent more time laughing at the stupidity of the movie than the part
neither of which rank high in the cagney credits.one of the great loss to cinema is the fact
where this is going.the most disappointing thing about something
and far from errol flynn 's best
the location and beautiful technicolour cinematography
and the story seems awfully contrived and cliche ' by today 's standard .
many person have also compared it to one of the all time great
this is my favorite jackie chan movie and in an interview ,
it was his favorite as well .
as some very funny scene as well .
this movie was a favorite of brandon lee ,
( who is one of the greatest villain in any jackie chan movie . )
you can expect some very funny scene
jackie is at his absolute best here .
the last fight scene at the mall is my favorite fight scene by anyone - period .
another chan classic and definitely one of his greatest movie .
that are so bad ,
that so bad
its just bad .
a perfect example
i found the story pretty damn funny .
whoopi - great !
it had a great cast
that a horror movie is terrible ?
the devil god is a large black man with a terrible case of pink eye.one of the `` freakiest '' momants in the film
starts screaming for minute on and on ( that is actually funny )
because the movie is just bad ...
and is completely original and unpredictable .
robert stack and dorothy malone- robert stack was terrible- just bloody horrible-
the plot was stupid
somehow dorothy malone won an oscar for best supporting actress-
although her campy tramp character was boring- think
forced and the end result was a waste of 99 minute .
the worst digger in the clan was a pompous ,
bonzai and ed arrived and nearly killed poor uncle max .
it was beautiful :
it was too ridiculous and silly .
being funny
just annoying .
because it is far too ridiculous and frivilous .
it would at least be aesthetically beautiful .
and boring .
a bad ending
the annoying child
who enjoy watching b grade bad movie
from a to b. this makes the film tedious in the extreme and the expected blood and gore payoff just never happens .
lar von trier woke film noir from the dead ,
and you can make it look stupid or realistic .
9/10 .
bruce almighty was enjoyable .
somewhat funny comedy .
that the male lead is not bad to look at surely helped ) ,
then as the middle came in i understood the boring stuff
it had about 3 of these pointless scene ,
it was not so boring but still a little dull .
oh and as a note rosario dawson still did a great job .
that to me is the mark of a great movie .
the emotional message of the movie were totally felt .
what fun !
buford 's beach bunnies gives b-grade tanda films a bad name .
thing go from bad to worse ,
begins a turbulent and heavy sexual affair with his beautiful co-worker ,
we thought was excellent ,
in spite of all the bad thing
one of the best argentine actor plays the small part of simon .
1st watched 12/7/2002 - 3/10
even my kid did not seem to care for this boring `adventure ' in the make-believe .
that a great part of the audience was too badly educated in the area
but pitt is amazing ,
and skerritt is perfectly cast as the father .
it is a perfect movie for anyone
this movie is one of the worst comedy movie i
all these new comedy are just horrible .
he can bounce back from this awful movie .
and will arnetts character is just plain bad .
the plot is truly the worst ever written .
rarely missing the mark ;
which is the worst of this year-
that the film will be a boring dhoom 2 style film ,
only it would be a bad film
it was even worst then dhoom 2 and what i expected first saif 's introduction
which is boring then saif- kareena meet ,
but then the film became more boring and with all the outdated stuff childhood romance
overdose of childish rajnikant style action scene and all boring scene
kareena is equally bad anil kapoor ham outrageously and spoils the show
and moved by the ave little boy and the beautiful eagle .
there was also the most annoying thing
it was awful
but that about sum up why this movie was a terrible adaption :
anything less is just pointless.if you loved the book ,
however some of the acting is just about awful
annoying side plot have become part of the story
all in all its a great show but not perfect .
the beautiful vega
as well as a funny bit with jonah hill
and i absolutely loved this movie .
and will be a favorite .
this is the worst attempt on a batman series .
the gospel of lou was a major disappointment for me .
it was neither great nor inspirational .
that is bad in his life ,
it is a great movie .
the movie is great ,
were the best actor i have been seen in a long time .
one of the best record of israel 's response to the murder of rabin.extremely true and natural ,
dudley moore is fantastic in this largley unknown classic .
this was an excellent idea
and the scenery was beautiful
but the casting was great in my opinion .
which was more annoying than anything else .
i absolutely loved the film though ,
with nicole and chaplin working against each other beautifully .
the humour is subtle ,
with some great 'office'-like scene at the bank ,
brit-filmmaking at its best ...
( 9/10 )
this was not all that great .
not terrible or hateful or anything ,
just forgettable.it had a sort of
so we were left with weak mix of the three .
in a been-done-before-but-still-funny sort of way.and i thought
and probably came out the most sympathetic character in the whole film.all in all
not great though .
and that is how the greatest comedy of tv started !
monica 's search for the `` perfect guy ''
( there is no perfect guy ,
i have loved airplane and flying .
it is absolutely amazing and i plan
it really is great for child and adult
what a waste of a talented cast and some great-looking set and costume .
it was funny .
it is sick humor at best .
the best use for this movie is for person
bad acting
bad over-acting
bad special effect
bad
bad
bad .
that is not only annoying but definitely fills out the empty spot ,
definitely avoidable
the light and color filter are sometimes badly chosen .
but the best actress is the landlady .
i enjoyed this film very much.tobey maguire gives a terrific performance as jake .
one of the all time best ever .
beautiful and touching movie .
great setting
the woman in black is fantastic in all aspect .
this film starts off as a reasonably solid and interesting ghost story .
arthur attends the funeral
amitabh 'babban ' bachchan plays the role of a psycho villain to the best
but the award for the `` worst performance and any role till date '' must go to nisha kothari .
this flick reminds me some really bad science-fiction movie from 50 's and 60's.it is not scary or interesting ,
but it is dull
cheesy and stupid.special effect are laughable ,
and the ending is simply awful.do not waste your money ,
better.i give it 3.5/10
because of its stupidity ) .
can be truly bad .
is one of the greatest director of all time
directing two of the greatest actor of all time
the beloved
( the best movie ever about holocaust )
and enjoyed the film
he was wonderful here
-- she apparently killed some horrible guy .
as he can.glenda farrell is an awful person .
really bad and alcoholic hamster !
she is pretty funny
amazingly
good '' movie is perfection of its genre .
`` enchanted april '' is one of the best movie ever made and my eternal love .
`` the hurt locker '' has won more `` best picture '' award from the critic group than any other film this year .
because it has a cheap ,
for she finds `` young catherine '' to be a great film and historically accurate .
that she was not `` great
like `` peter the great '' in 1986
is one more example of how badly russia is portrayed in the west .
this is a wonderful movie in a lot of way .
everyone in my family enjoyed it .
the animation is excellent and easily demonstrates
`` spirit '' was a great eath of fresh air .
`` spirit '' is another example of great animated fare .
the film has a perfect opportunity for laugh
and can shoot out flame of fire from her mouth
is the one running joke i enjoyed ) .
but the film slowly gets worse each passing minute .
they are to make funny
with very poor production value
which is a messy mix of comedy and drama ,
subtlety was never his strong point.highlight ?
but at least it is fun ,
the conflict and warmth so prevalent to fellowe 's screenplay are conveyed perfectly here by all involved
it is got a perfectly touching and human sense of affection within its perfectly paced romance
and there lacks a certain significance to its overall presence
yet in a sense this is what makes it enjoyable .
beloved infidel was the exception .
by producing terribly bad and cheesy horror movie .
it is a terrible waste of time and energy .
does not have to put on a stupid maillot for that .
great atmosphere and terror follow.the multiple nightmare sequence were pretty freaky .
`` the ogre '' is not perfect ,
more lethargic and worse-staged version out there somewhere ,
having seen it on mst3k help
the best part are the mst riff .
best line ?
`` i am gon na unleash the great dane '' ,
playing shakespeare 's greatest character much like a department store mannequin would
he is a great actor ,
for the mst3k version.good-night
this is an excellent movie
with a great story and great acting .
about it while the funny element are present too .
that evil guy in the glass is amazing .
it is one of the best blitzkriegs put on screen .
it is quite amazing watching the character falling/jumping/running/driving through all manner of panes.all three movie are great .
but i saw a perfect trilogy with sense and incredible stunt
that is also excellent
no.1 - great
( in all aspect - it is one gripping story from the very beginning to the very end ) and funny ( many scene are ridiculous ) ;
is incredible ) and bombastic
( the 2nd film has the best option
.solid 10/10 .
i enjoyed barbara bel gedde as the stalwart ,
i also enjoyed paul douglas-he seemed to play this role many time ,
it is desperately unmotivated and boring
and certainly one of the funniest woman on earth .
is undoubtedly her best effort .
in ten perfectly choreographed and staged scene
that is both sexy and uniquely funny .
i can usually find something redeeming in every movie i watch .
it does have its redeeming moment .
that bothered me very greatly
mormon are stupid ,
horrible
each with its own terrible impact yet unconnected.at a station
quite ridiculous in fact .
this one appeared to be shot through gauze.the story was boring
and the movie shed no historical light on a very interesting period of time and set of circumstances.a total disappointment .
is quite a fun and somewhat innovative fair.though
) too bad they only released it on dvd/vcd in a few country in the worls
he is so amazing and neat looking as well .
1st watched 5/26/2002 - 4/10
when some lame one-liner and attempt at litening up the mood do not work at all .
and avoid this film .
i found this tale to be at least less annoying than other cannon movie tale .
it is one of the best .
some of the song are pretty bad
this is a beautifully decorated period piece ;
wonderfully done .
( and his making fun of himself in the end ) ,
and the stupid prince
were all quite funny
and seem to be ridiculous quite on purpose .
it is terrible .
predictable `` action '' movie ,
this movie shows the decay of film and the film industry to cheap gag and dull
but the threesome 's comedic timing is at its honed best here .
there are other more subtle ,
but just as funny .
but he is somehow funny .
who is now my favorite band of all time.just watch
as it is one bad film and even franco ,
is awful .
the film is so boring
the kidnap plot is one of the dullest i
as a horror film sexo cannibal fails and as an action adventure
this is one to avoid.director franco shows his usual incompetence throughout ,
the cannibal scene are poor ,
the action is lame
it becomes incredibly dull and tedious to watch after about 10 minute
the gore is not that great
this is a shoddy poorly made film with awful special effect and rock bottom production value .
the music suck and sound effect become annoying
but no one in this thing can act.sexo cannibal is a terrible film
of being as boring as hell .
one to avoid .
the somewhat predictable storyline prove surprisingly deep and moving
immersing himself in fantastical video game
whom they loved .
it is also a great title
is his usual likable and funny self
but funnier .
it is a pity the director fails
gandhi my father is narrated to you like that boring history lesson
it is not enough that kasturba blames her husband for the way her son turned out -
is not that it is a bad film ,
gandhi my father is a disappointment
it is a wonderful performance ,
but akshaye ings a rare concoction of innocence and despondency to that part and succeeds in making harilal a pitiable figure .
that is the actor 's best contribution to that role .
it is just so boring.director feroz abbas khan 's gandhi my father
this movie deserved better it is great fun ,
has some wonderful joke and sight gag
... amazing as captain amazing ,
and no one else could be the shoveller except william h. macy my favorite line in the film ?
i was sorely disappointed in 'corky romano ' .
while certainly a funny movie ,
while part of the movie are quite predictable ,
it is damn funny !
that the acting is excellent ,
it is beautifully shot
i really enjoyed the 60 's .
and i was pretty disappointed .
just because i love new york and i loved the cast !
terrible movie .
you should avoid seeing in 2006 ,
what a waste of time .
other than couple of cheap laugh this movie achieves nothing
the dialog is cheap ,
how not to act this is a perfect example of bad acting .
angela landsbury made a perfect miss price ,
while david thomilson made a great desperate entertainer love interest .
the dialog was not great ,
the interview at the police office is a marvel of bland obstinacy with a little fear of the future blended in .
the humor was terrible
that this movie was suppose to be great ,
but it was not more than a cheesy waste of time .
that the acting in this movie was terrible no of the actor in this movie had chemistry ,
alice eve did a great job
the humor in this movie was not funny at all ,
it would have been a more enjoyable film .
we are introduced to a bunch of annoying loudmouth
it the disappointment was overwhelming .
this is one of the great story of the twentieth century :
but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction .
that were supposed to be funny
even though it got a bad review in the paper .
-- i thouroughly enjoyed both woody allen 's 'everything you ever wanted to know about sex
... ' and michael hanneke 's 'funny game ' --
avoid this film at all cost ,
it should be relegated to the annal of history as a lesson in bad cinema .
and is fascinating to watch unfold on screen.streisand fought hard
lighthearted fun ,
disappointingly
are wasted here in very small role ,
though the picture is never laff-out-loud funny
a fantastic arabian adventure .
i found ahmad and his princess a little boring
always a fun actor ,
makes a great villain ,
and sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieve ,
i also really loved mile malleson as the sultan of basra
he collects amazing toy from around the world .
this probably would count as one of the great child 's film of all time ,
and the scene with the giant spider look especially awful .
8/10 .
lou lambada diamond phillip ' 1990 satanic serial killer yuppie hell-fest ... 1 ) lou diamond phillip was recently indicted for beating up his wife
and amazing east
that sadly remains in place over her torso
but the villain in this movie is wonderful ,
line could be the best overlooked movie phrase since `` thank for the ride
and one of the fun thing
you will have fun so long
as you steadfastly refuse to take it seriously.4/10
absolutely superb )
( excellent )
it is a perfect way
part of the fun of the bourne series is the constant globe-hopping and manipulation of technology and communication
this will be the perfect end to it .
this show is terrible ,
and just getting worse and worse .
little mosque on the prairie is typically awful bland cbc comedy
the joke are totally predictable
which is different and could/should have led to a great show .
this movie is not only boring ,
it is also really badly done .
the graphic are so bad ,
they are dreadful .
it is a bit boring .
this is bad even for backyard wrestling .
that even give yard tard a bad name ,
so do not waste your time or your cash on this crappy dvd ,
that perfectly captures the look and feel of the surreal 1950s ,
the colorful crisp cinematography and the excellent cast ,
funny
this film is truly funny ,
if you do not find this movie funny
was one slight disappointment for me however .
that chris rock is funnier than warren beatty any second of any day of any week of any year of any ...
because it is the funniest thing
the plot of this enjoyable mgm musical is contrived and only occasionally amusing
the technical illiance of powell is evidenced during one incredible scene within
and that is it use subtle technique
because sometime the best element of fear is not what actually happens ,
this is such a great scene
absolutely awful movie .
utter waste of time.background music is so loud
is actually unintelligible.camera work is bad ,
and beautiful portrait of them as young woman vie for space on the wall next
edie 's favorite costume is a pair of short with panty hose
`` edie is still beautiful at 56 . ''
this movie is one of my favorite !
the shooting scene are ridiculous though ,
it has a lot of great humor
gackt is a superb actor i must say..he show so much emotion .
wang lee hom is absolutely great .
perfect for this movie .
who has the bad luck
used to live.easily the worst
`` doll '' and bad home movie .
but john hamilton is hopelessly dull as the villain
( perfectly cast lionel atwill originated the role )
and warren hymer 's nitwit shtick is pretty annoying .
not the best of the film to be watched nowadays .
but this movie disappointed me .
i would also rank this as one of his best film
and fun enough to be an amazingly good guilty pleasure and thankfully
it almost washed out the rancid bad taste of the ludicrously preachy `` philidelphia '' from my mouth .
barbera steele is sadly wasted
but do not let those gripe stop you from watching an otherwise enjoyable movie.my grade : b- dvd extra : 5 minute roger corman interview ; cast and crew bio ; original trailer ; and trailer for `` candy stripe nurse ''
boring
the general plot was good but developed in such an insipid and boring fashion
too bad such a serious subject
and such great actor could create such a flop .
brannagh 's version of hamlet is by far the best .
would be a nice little gem .
it really does not.unfortunately
that happen are quite predictable ,
a great vehicle
that is so trite and predictable
( not to mention reminiscent of a lot of bad television show )
but the weakness are so glaring
is so unbelievably bad ,
the plot is pathetic ,
the acting awful ,
and the dialogue is even more predictable than the ending.avoid at all cost !
i am disappointed
and the final outcome is not predictable :
is a boring retelling of the theory of eaking down the molecular structure of an object ,
a completely pointless movie with no message at all .
unfortunately
to set the time-line.i enjoyed the movie
but the situation were predictable
the acting was not too bad ,
and the `` cupid '' killer was believable and disturbing.the bad :
the story line and plot of this movie is incredibly weak .
but a bad story .
we have some highly laughable special effect and rampant pseudo-science masquerading as science fiction .
prior to that is some rather poor quality space crew boarding a space ship ,
it were not so damn funny .
the best being the `` ratbatpidercrab . ''
and poorly imagined
.2/10 modern score
4/10 overall .
and the special effect are near perfection
the narrator 's voice is fun to listen to and the cinematography gives me the impression
i have recommended my family and friend to turn on `` pushing daisy ''
found this `` revisioning '' of a great play and worthy 1972 film
a horrible movie experience .
are crass and unsympathetic .
that fails at every turn .
i am going to say that it looks great .
cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic cinematographer .
this movie has great star in their earlier year :
and though it is not the best movie i have ever seen ,
and conclusions.it is a great film ,
even if it is not the greatest kurosawa film .
and person 's personality are not solid thing .
delusive dead end.this is very different to what is depicted in this ridiculous `` cure ''
`` perfect blue ''
and stupid plot trick .
this is pretty bad .
the play is not great
that you are watching a very poor film by a director
mira sorvino 's central performance is eath-takingly poor :
that she is best able to handle the material -
sadly
who was responsible for this mess .
and this mess was just plain badly done and an insult to my intelligence .
and loved only one of them
but occasionally is not a bad thing now ,
( highly recommended ) ,
i had to fast forward through this poorly transferred dvd after about 30 minute
it is just a poorly executed film.i would like to see a cleaned up version
that is best
the plot is stupid .
then the movie gets more boring and boring until
most movie are not a complete waste of time ,
the ending is very predictable ,
tedious
and boring .
but it is the best
there are so many stupid momant in 'tower of death'/'game of death 2 '
when the body is stolen during the funeral
but it does not stop the film from being a mess.ok ,
this middle section is awful
and contains excellent choreography.but even the finale disappoint
this sounded great
leopard-skinned henchman and stupid monk .
but so stupid sometime that it hurts .
it won the bafta twice for best entertainmant
it won the british comedy award for best comedy entertainmant programme
best comedy talk show ,
it was number 52 on the 100 greatest funny momants .
the movie itself is so pathetic .
the movie itself is more boring than pathetic .
it is so boring
it starts out badly with image from the voyager probe and blind willie mctell
why the old blue great were really so great ,
nobody should be forced to see these badly done reenactment .
avoid at all cost .
the fly were kinda mediocre anthropomorphic ,
its lot of scientific mumbo jumbo mixed in what is really a dull film of a bunch of person wandering around in the wilderness .
but to be perfectly honest there is nothing here worth
seeing outside of some great looking shot of the wild .
this is a perfect definition of an exploitation film ,
but film noir fan should definitely find this one a gripping piece of work ,
the bandw photography of conrad hall does a superb job right from the start.also clear from the start :
they do a great job of portraying free spirited buddy
one for the rich and one for the poor
it was truly a stupid
this movie was so bad ,
in a bad way ... the character acting is the poorest thing
most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen .
my favorite part was when they are in the carriage ,
then it switches to a far-shot with a ridiculous cg horse .
it felt like a horrible episode of hercule ,
worst .
that one of his white trailer trash travelling companion [ pitt ] is a serial killer himself.rather predictable throughout ,
i loved this film
today at 17 it is one of my all time favorite animated film .
beautiful animation and appealing character are just two of the thing to like about this film .
adgth never fails to make me cry
arguably one of the greatest non-disney animated film of all time .
i enjoyed this film
good fun to watch elvira comment on this crappy movie ... .have fun with bad movie .
how bad the 70 's were for horror flick bad effect ,
bad dialog
just bad movie
avoid this unless you want to laugh at it .
the movie is very poor
very cheaply made .
it is the best movie and person
it is the worst.stigmatum would not be the worst movie i
in great pain
or maybe i was distracted by the terrible filming and mtv like style .
that she rarely speaks ) ,
`` two '' is a great example
and it is great to see two person
this is a great movie .
to avoid a stiff prison sentence after a minor ush with the law .
and not what i have come to expect from the great italian director .
there is nothing even slightly reminiscent of the great horror writer in this tale ,
unfortunately
and so the theme quickly becomes annoying .
this film is extremely mediocre and not a good representation of fulci 's talent .
it is horrible.there are report
but good performance were quickly overshadowed by horrible ...
and i do mean horrible special effect .
made to it in that `` seinfeld '' episode with jerry trying to get kramer to florida on that bus and kramer 's all sick and with a nosebleed.the movie was great ,
and surprisingly upbeat and not all pissy pretentious pessimistic like some movie i can not even remember
and surprisingly he and joe become friend ,
and ratso rizzo would grow up to be the legendary and beloved dustin hoffman .
great movie .
but a great one ,
and fit in with the tone of the movie perfectly .
it is great ,
of course goldblum and dreyfus were great
rob reiner made a great laughing limo driver
and gaiel byrne a laughable neurotic .
funny but not as good as the first film .
followed by nice dreams.recommended .
`` spaced invader '' is one of the funniest movie ,
it\u00b4s funny
i have seen bad film
some one has a gun and maybe talk rubbish whilst high on drugs.avoid this film like the plague .
bad i could not sit through it
i could not recall one joke or funny line worthy of the description .
watching the girl in bikinis was the only distraction during this horrible experience.it is hard to imagine that adam sandler
he was not funny in the least in this movie
underrated gem has lost nothing of the power
it was probably just a lame excuse
approach and act stupidly around a bull elephant while standing too close to it.any real african bull elephant that was not from the circus
the movie may be great .
that i was disappointed with the film .
this little gem was mainly promoted as a comedy upon its release in sweden ,
funny bit on small-town bickering are there to enjoy
it also raises poignant question on respecting difference of people ' lifestyle choices.great character ensemble with many superb
the international attention probably would have been immediate.7/10 from ozjeppe .
i am not a big fan of rom/com at the best of time .
is avoid .
as he struts aimlessly around social function
and cukor does an excellent job
especially because it is his obsession with her and jealousy of her
and insignificance is a perfect example.the characterization are illiant ,
the story is excellent
because it is likely you will be disappointed.but i think
it is excellent .
only to substitute with horrible special affect .
to become great movie ,
should avoid seeing this movie at all cost .
this is yet another terrific and wonderful movie by the fraternal twin
it is fun
anyway ; it is a great movie in every sense of the word ,
that you will not be disappointed !
to sat how awful the shield is ,
that it is a monument to bad directing .
-- make person do awful thing
each is great on
wasted .
by being involved with both side of the conflict in a mysterious and film noir-ish way ,
its amazing to watch the naive leopold deal with everything
annoying passenger
the film is endlessly unpredictable.the film stylishly shot ,
is now a personal favorite film of mine .
what a dreadful film this is .
you would want to sit through this mess
the tanner family is a perfect family
a perfectly hypothetical family .
that person enjoyed watching it ,
but would take back a message however childish
that message be .
that is rarely present after many other show .
my daughter invited me to watch this with her and i was not disappointed at all .
jame gandolfini was funny
it has lot 's of funny moment ,
all in all i loved this movie
the very best acting performance is that of ralph richardson as the boss .
1/10.this is the kind of movie
you just wasted 2 hour of your life
i give it a 6/10
its a great film about sailor on a 24 hour pass in new york and ,
and loved for it .
which is contra to his comedy style.thinking back on the great grant comic performance
and he is the great reactor
the role would be perfected later by jame garner
but here grant just is not funny
( see funny face
until the invention of the vcr and cable television resurrected this petrified turkey.so the lesson here is whatever the 'goof ' it will be ignored in a great film like citizen kane
if it was not for the bad dialogue and script .
was a solid script
even if the result lately are rather poor .
poor acting
it uses the same closet/under the bed/person-behind-you-in-the-mirror tactic over and over again making it repetitive and boring ,
and scaring yourself to have enjoyed this ,
or enjoyed it tremendously.but this film is awful and i feel
it is one thing to rent a `` bad '' movie at blockbuster from the weinstein
though no way near as bad as this piece of crap
this is a long lost horror gem starring sydney lassick
) lover in a rather boring sub plot
( i do not want to give style a bad name ) .
and who in their right mind gave the greenlight to this dreary and tangled mess .
bound to be enlightening and fascinating on about a million level
is almost irrelevant.to make matter about a thousand time worse ,
and decided to call the resulting mess a movie
pathetic.i wanted to like this movie .
pointless .
predictable
and mostly annoying .
than that it is very forgettable imagery.although i
that your kid see mindless cheap-joke )
but everyone else should not waste their money .
this movie is really not all that bad .
the set are cheap ,
and stayed true to the character of one of my favorite story .
it is stupid and devoid of any semblance of story
it is exquisite boredom in beautiful picture .
i struck on `` not even bad
not even bad .
it has been one of my 10 favorite film
this is very much like a not so bad student film .
morris makes fun of 'enshrined mediocrity '
this is a terrible film
and this are not no fun .
it is bad
it is down right awful .
that the 1972 movie is bad
it is funny ,
but was implemented in the worst possible way .
the acting and sound is awful .
this might qualify for a `` so bad
and this is just crap-it is just soooo cheap ,
the `` child '' actress is seriously god awful-i pray her acting career
the film as a whole is a good example of a solid
7/10.on a pedantic note
knows how an excellent cast
i would have walked out about 15 minute into this dreadful waste of celluloid.neil simon would not write another screenplay for this version
any of them were funny ?
the actor do their best and are appealing ,
to overcome all the glaring fault of poor writing
a pointless sex scene all feature along the way.the film stumble through a few obvious set-piece
and the film had quite a weak ending ,
and i`m talking panned so badly
this movie has something going for itit gets off to a bad start
bad guy enter the templechild sits with blank expressionbad guy chop up the monkchild sits with blank expressionbad guy
obviously this might have been cool and funky at the time
i blame the director personally
that both the screenwriter and producer should share equal blame too .
this game was really great and quite a challenge .
it has a great
a truly great game for rpg and shoot'em'up fan . >
and even worse
and even that becomes boring rather quickly .
and pull a really pathetic face .
funny
paz vega is a beautiful and smart woman .
probably my all-time favorite movie
but it is not preachy or boring .
in one of her very few truly sympathetic role
i loved this movie .
great storyline and actor and good movie set .
the movie was fascinating .
swayze did a great job .
this is some of his best work .
as being one of the best tv film ever aired .
congrat to the producer and writer of such a great piece of work .
it is arguably one of the best horror film
possibly one of the best ever made.the filmmaker have crafted a movie
`a chinese ghost story ' is a beautiful epic love story told
this film offers something for every film fan.director siu-tung ching and producer tsui hark assembled a truly amazing cast for this film .
the direction is superb .
or just anyone looking for great way
that it was a huge disappointment .
it was a huge disappointment to see a complex character like achille
trying to make the best of a ridiculous script .
it was actually a waste of so much talent
and orlando bloom and sean bean were pathetic ) .
but were extremely disappointed.the actor
he is an awful actor ,
it is as predictable
and really a waste of time ,
just is not shocking orinteresting or funny ,
it is kind of boring .
not a lot of fun .
it was so bad that both of us cracked up laughing at how bad it was .
horrible
horrible
horrible .
continuity was terrible .
because he supposedly makes film with a `` message ''
the film ' role as a political satire fails miserably
has been out in the badland a little too long.the conclusion of the film return to the bounty hunter
orson welle is still my favorite mr r ,
energy and timeless beauty make rosie the perfect role for her .
vanessa 's singing talent shows beautifully with all the song
the choreography was bad
that although lengthy the acting by vanessa is superb
this version is wonderful and i recommend
this movie is maybe one of the most boring movie of 2000
especially the music fails
that were great ,
about this film is that it is nowhere near as annoying as the stink of flesh .
it all already.bad movie fan will have a ball
who was so bad
and kudos to hardgore for getting in to the spirit of thing by releasing a print so bad it felt
like i was watching some beat up home video of a camping trip.awful
awful stuff .
avoid .
it has beautiful person ...
are my favorite pabst-directed film
despite there being greater unemploymant in germany .
( illustrated wonderfully in a dance hall scene )
the film 's impact was minimal at best .
had great message of peace and harmony
it is an amazing and sad relic
the acting is so apathetic at time and so over-dramatic at other time .
forgettable character and an even more forgettable plot make this one of the most ill-conceived movie i
stay away unless you are into bad movie .
( aside from the awful crime
and much more fun to watch
how dull the end was treated ...
this film a fascinatingly stupid ... it is a must of silliness .
the film is not ever boring ,
there are some weakness
is ridiculous .
that most of the time was not even funny .
that he had do really awful joke ,
what once was a truly great show with an equally great concept
that for once was not about a dysfunctional family
with just one usually lame joke placed somewhere to divert attention
among the best comedy ever oadcast .
how pathetic a life rosetta had ,
the whole thing was filled with un-likeable and unsympathetic character .
as a great romance
but is crippled by the single-handedly worst direction of a film i
wow i loved this movie !
great !
i loved the fact
the love story is portrayed beautifully
the movie did not prefer to give any boring social commentary
his desperation in certain sequence is portrayed beautifully .
she has given a great performance of a woman
that is unnecessary.good thriller 10/10
this is one of the best film i
it is one of the worst i have ever seen.ok ,
was just an annoying person .
being extremely annoying .
bland
mary tyler moore and valerie harper both looked wonderful -
it was so bad ,
almost automatically.it is rare for a movie to have suspense .
the best thing
in them also was the constant tension.acting is not bad :
because it sounded pretty interesting but to my horror this movie was the worst movie i
i have seen what i thought to be the absolutely worst
the actor deserve applause for trying to salvage a very poor job of direction .
so often it is almost laughable
i loved the original .
and just gets annoying .
the end in the original was fantastic !
and great performance by kurt russell and
a great renter .
the music in it is great .
this is actually one of my favorite of his movie - second ,
it is also best
this movie is not only the funniest film ever created ,
it is the greatest .
it is one of the best movie ever .
amazing plot ...
you have been ever looking for ... the very best
the very best ever .
they are disappointed .
it is simply the best .
but they are all wasted .
the southern star features a pretty forgettable title tune
it pretty much establishes the tone for this bloated and rather dull feature
and poorly composed and dull photography by raoul coutard ,
she is beautiful
that this was a great classic comedy mystery
unfortunately no one told me about the musical number
this would not be so bad
worse its
charle middleton is very funny is his scene
its a fun movie of the sort they do not make any more .
most of us first encounter keaton in one of the illiant feature film from his great period of independent production :
unfortunately
durante plays one of those annoying hepcat
there is a painfully unfunny dialogue scene
is absolutely perfect for the character
is even less funny than usual here ,
offering a running gag with a stupid payoff .
( a much funnier movie ) .
is wasted.part of the problem with 'speak easily ' is that supporting character behave in completely inappropriate way .
keaton 's lawyer shows up at durante 's theatre with an urgent message for keaton ...
about half an hour into the unfunny 'speak easily ' ,
the great jimmy durante seat himself at the piano
most annoying of all is the ending of this film ,
) i very nearly wept - in anger and sorrow - at the wasted opportunity in 'speak easily ' .
first i was very disappointed with john hurt 's performance here .
the best part of the film was the end .
but it got a bit boring at time .
when walmart had this movie really cheap for sale
it is just boring ,
al gore no more truly cares about the environment than most folk care about contacting foot fungus .
if it is not his best ,
is weak in every sense of the word .
to see how rotten this film was.what amazes me the most is that a number of other talented person took part in a movie with a very weak premise
a great comedian
are not even close to funny
that is incredibly disappointing too ,
alley plays a british heiress with an awful british accent
and every joke was poorly set up
and poorly timed
the physical gag are also incredibly predictable
dangerfield has made some great
that is funny ,
which is precisely the case with this lame excuse for a wasted 90 minute .
it has the best cast of talent i have seen in a very long time .
but a lot of my friend also loved it
i really loved the character
not to waste our time
how it could get such a `` high '' vote with an average of 6.8/10.so
you will just waste your time unless
an excellent
( but nevertheless beautiful ) ,
but the making of an excellent film .
there are some great actor here
only a horrible effort gone wrong .
frank loesser 's music sounds great .
that original cast included the wonderful vivian blaine and stubby kaye ,
that could have made an amazing contribution.the film
is amazing .
ms. blaine makes a fantastic impression as the show girl
`` plan 9 from outer space '' is the worst movie
of *course* they are bad .
from its lonely summit of awfulness
but went on to make more awful movie .
if we get too annoying '
but that show is just plain stupid .
they wasted it with a slug-slurping contest between timon and simba .
but stupid song .
7/10
unfortunately
while not the worst of the dtv sequel completely lacks the sparkle.the biggest letdown is a lack of a story .
still manages to make a mess of the story .
the antic of jaq and gus are the redeeming merit of this movie.the
this is the best ,
because the mice were at their funniest here .
the worst of the vignette ,
this was also marred by a rather ridiculous subplot about lucifer falling in love with pompom.the incidental music
and nothing like the beautiful tchaikovsky inspired melody of the original.the character were the strongest development here .
the duke had some truly funny moment
the mice were the redeeming merit of the movie ,
and the voice acting was surprisingly good.all in all
4/10 for the mice
because the acting was so bad .
p diddy needs to stop tainting movie with his horrible acting ,
who looks excellent in this movie
that i have seen.i enjoyed the acting of all of the major player .
i especially enjoyed til schweiger and alan arkin .
alan arkin has most of the funniest line .
but it can sometimes be very funny .
this is one of our great national story .
although i have enjoyed bing crosby in other movie ,
and then finally annoying .
as are the great costume -
but unfortunately the story does get a bit dull towards the middle and the overuse of stock footage as well
as poor special effect sink this film to the sub-par level.the film
unfortunately
the story idea is not bad and rather original .
this must me one of the worst takes on vampire ever
this one lacks
to keep him weak ,
just weak )
it is a shockingly bad effort
that management allowed this movie to see the light of day speak volume about their incompetence and desperation .
this movie joins my very short `` worst movie of all time '' list .
whether they are good or bad ,
it lacks brendan fraser 's charm ,
but christopher only really fails in that specific comparison
from the subtle gesture towards a joke
some of the funniest blink and you will miss
all in all an excellent film
a beautiful score from badalamenti
this is a beautiful slice of life film .
and i do mean tacky score to the really bad acting
it is a deadly dull affair starring john carradine with some gray in his hair
she wrote.for an ultra-cheap monogram quickie ,
the color are superb -
since all the celluloid they wasted is good for nothing more
not only is the writing atrocious and the joke awful ,
but the camera work and film quality are amateur at best .
the worst part of all is that i actually sat through the whole thing .
that made some person in the film annoying .
it may sound great
a wonderful performer .
great to see some of my favorite actor
fragglerock is excellent in the way
that schindler 's list was excellent .
a great watch for child and adult of all gender .
i enjoyed it very much as a child .
he enjoyed it as well
was this bad .
but the execution was ridiculous .
they attached the good name of halloween to this fiasco.the basic premise surrounds some frat douche bag hosting their annual halloween haunted house fund raiser ,
the acting is about as bad
the script is unintentionally funny .
offensive and downright disgusting pop-culture mess of a show
that i was not a bit disappointed
but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really god-awful no-name comedian to display what they more than likely think is their comedic skill *rolls eyes* ... more like lack-thereof
because they are all so terribly unfunny and pathetic in their attempt at so-called `` humor ''
i was very disappointed .
this is a poorly made film ,
it is so bad ,
which means it is painfully bad .
and just plain lame .
were probably looking for the next cult classic or hidden `` gem ''
the camera was not bad at all for a cheap movie like this ,
and also the atmosphere was not too bad .
it was horrible ,
so badly just for single scene .
the acting was bad
but i have seen worse .
but i have seen worse .
if you like gory movie with stupid plot
gave it 3/10 ,
and does a great job with the comedy
she wears some beautiful street clothe ,
binnie barne is delightful as the real lady mere.the color in this is a mess ,
that the story lacks a bit of consistency .
but all this is largely compensated by the excellent psychological development.this is definitely one of the best movie about gambling .
for stating my disappointment with this movie .
and was disappointed .
i was disappointed in the lousy editing and lame script .
i was very disappointed on the resolution after the climax .
there have been other cheap movie
the acting was horrible nor many of the landscape shot .
and directing were very weak .
the incredible melting man plays like an extended episode of the six million dollar man
are not the best .
it was a lot of fun .
it really is a fun little film ,
the transfer is rather poor ,
i was sorely disappointed not only in the acting credential but in the silly story line
do not waste your time .
this movie is actually worse
it is got terrible
forced dialogue ; pointless plot development ; really drawn out 'spooky imagery ' scene ,
5/10 at best attractive woman ; long
boring sex scene
because that movie was pretty funny ,
the second in the vacation series is easily the least enjoyable one ,
and the very funny eric idle is completely wasted in a small role as a very unlucky englishman .
and almost universally not funny at all
what a waste of time and money !
it `` might be funny '' .
the actor are trapped in a poorly written script
the joke are weak and tired ,
which hid the awful effect quite nicely .
and the funny scene were not funny .
none of the character were really sympathetic ,
it would still be a waste of money !
and she is as sweet as ever in this wonderful movie .
it is awfully underrated and deserves accolade and attempt at a revival .
great movie
rock 'n ' roll high school is *still* the greatest rock 'n ' roll movie
for the boring
the minute you give an 'art film ' 1/10 ,
and i am sparing you the unbelievably long and pointless ,
gay or strait its a great doco for anyone
very funny
never dull .
great access .
some of the performance and just amazing .
great .
10/10 .
my favorite sequence contain one in the sex-ed classroom
quite possibly the worst psychiatrist on earth .
the film is loaded with inspired casting choices..just littered with funny character and the cast interpretations..such as ed mcmahon as a very conservative military blowhard
loved adam in the lead..he is the perfect foil for the gag
that my favorite part of this movie
that exemplifies the sheer pointless
stupidity and inanity of the proceedings ,
that is the kind of lousy
because the movie has complete contempt for their characters.two other incredibly painful sequence also ramp up the stupidity of the proceedings :
you have never watched a more pointless and irritating setup with odder looking person in your entire life .
but solid and unobtrusive .
this definitely falls into the 'so bad
and mst 's coverage of it is great fun ,
and it is perfectly clear in most of the film :
actor are known and with great quality
the film result boring and probably you will spend most of the time
of course there are lot of worse film ,
the earth is now poison gas wasteland of pollution and violence .
and unfortunately she destroys the favorite tank of tank police commander charle britain
a big revolver and a bad temper .
uneven in place but still a lot of fun.followed by `` new dominion :
.this movie is one of the all-time best for sheer fun and nonbelieveability .
steven oliver was perfect for the part of dugan ,
and being disappointed ,
that this movie was terrible .
downright terrible .
surprisingly for the reason mentioned in the first review .
that the movie `` definitely lacks good-looking female . ''
it is mixed perfectly to give us
light and funny comedy .
i could not stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old lady in a drugstore.i love european film ,
that many friend enjoyed as much as myself .
even more fascinating have always been the tale of impossible love ,
rarely leaves the city and prefer not to think about the \u0084crap
predictable product of the \u0084bubble '' .the opening scene of the film take us to a checkpoint on a road to nablus
\u0084the bubble '' is also a beautiful film about person
but its strong message and emotional impact will not leave you untouched .
it is utterly pointless to rate this film .
whether they are good or bad.terry gilliam of course is a natural for this kind of film .
but his very best
( underplayed to great effect by bruce willis ) .
that something terrible is coming this way ,
a part of a greater plot ?
it is a fascinating sequence ,
( the poor guy 's monogram even curses him )
no cheap gag \u0097 just funny character in uncomfortable situation .
great stuff .
that minimizes editing and maximizes the wonderful eight-room apartment set .
why mess it up ?
in that great effect is made from a large depth of field and the interplay between the various plane of action .
but the kind which is bad for the movie ,
the movie had that dull ,
and become their own worst enemies.this lethal virus gives you the shingle
sadly
as fun-loving brian
and pays an awful price .
`` irr\u00e9versible '' cinematographer beno\u00eet debie does a fantastic job with his widescreen lensing and as unsavory as this road trip becomes ,
unfortunately
perfectly played all around .
this is a `` bad film '' .
it is so very fun !
there is bad one-liner ,
in the end this is a horrendous movie of boring proportion .
which are predictable .
that is worse than any given episode of a downmarket 25-year old tv show .
gainey 's sheriff roscoe is a bland thug
but worse than the script or the casting is jay chandrasekhar 's hopeless direction :
( and badly )
this was a huge disappointment
considering the great cast ,
precious little excitement and too many dull spot
it was not one of her more popular films.it is also too bad a film had the waste of the talent of actor like richard widmark
this movie is all about subtlety and the difficulty of navigating the ever-shifting limit of more
it is a beautifully filmed human story .
unfortunately ,
boring
poorly filmed
this lifetime movie has some of the best acting i
the best performance in the movie comes from michael seater ,
his acting was especially great in the scene
also does a great job.a movie well worth watching ,
the bad news is it is still really dreadful .
because occasionally some of this kitchy slapstick parody actually seems funny.it is supposed to be better than `` mulva
`` 2 '' it is.maybe the best thing
and squishes the whole mess into about an hour of truly awful amateur video.you would best smoke a lot of something powerful
great cinematography
sitting with some friend watching a bad movie ,
and how poor the acting was ;
jigsaw is quite possibly the worst movie ever made or conceived ,
the head is the worst getting a camera in the eye
it has been standard horrible movie fair
bad acting
yet after jigsaw catch fire thing take a turn for the worst ... jigsaw comes alive.. how you ask ?
they do not even show him steal away a torso from his poor creator
with her bland suit and superfluous hair gel
that are thoroughly bad and yet comedic .
this is probably karisma at her best
nana patekar also gives out his best ,
the supporting case was even great ,
it was great to watch her.the set were also pretty good .
while it was never my favorite musical or story ,
since it is still a lot of fun to watch .
i heard horrible thing about grease 2
that it really was not all that bad and my friend agreed ,
as these t-bird were just stupid and ridiculous.another year at rydell and the music and dancing has not stopped .
part one was a fascinating experiment ,
part two is the excellent culmination of this experiment.this movie offers all of the same attributes from the first one
it is a ave and fascinating experiment
this comedy has some tolerably funny stuff in it ,
surrounded by a lot of unfunny stuff .
is a waste of time .
writer/director jame cameron has done a great job
the two lead in the film are great in their role
titanic makes for a great date movie
how it was that eugene logan came to be the technical adviser to a movie of such an amazing person as truman capote .
cinderella is one of disney 's greatest film
i consider the film to have been the greatest of his film at the time of its release .
one of the greatest character disney ever created .
and figure in the somewhat predictable finale.what is not quite predictable is how thing eventually wind up there ,
hence not quite as formulaic a plot as a lot of good other/bad other western do .
fast talking ruby perfectly .
that is acted perfectly .
tv movie might be very fun sometime ,
but the worse is that those action scene are very tasteless like the whole movie .
the movie was not fun even one second to me ,
having as the background the rehearsal and recording of `` sympathy for the devil '' in the classic album `` beggar 's banquet '' by the revolutionary bad boy rolling stone \u0096 mick jagger
the narrative and the footage are awful ,
that gunbuster is one of my favorite anime of all time .
that good.haliday caught a lot of good natured ribbing from the mst3k crew for his part in this movie and in `` devil doll '' ,
but he is actually the best thing in tpm .
the script bog down any forward momentum the plot may have in a mire of nonsense about funding and university politic and a guy
then when poor haliday gets mutilated by his machine ,
that were as bad or worse ,
perfect for a horror movie film festival ,
i personally loved it for the amazing animation ,
there is a deeper message behind it
and i mean bad .
your directing is poor ,
and you will save movie goer some money and a bad night.vote :
1/10
it awfully seems so .
these stupid slasher movie push the credibility envelope more and more by the minute .
the acting is mediocre at best .
forgettable
self-assured attitude and his bad-ass sneer
and loved is gone .
jumping on the `` backward message in metal music '' bandwagon
less successful entry in this mini-genre include the awful black rose and silly the gate ) .
eddie 's favorite rock star is sammi curr
( `` waste'em all ... no false metal ! '' )
that was a wonderful show
that made the original so loved .
that delivers a great performance .
and unfunny romp through the history of the film director 's love life and professional life .
the ridiculousness is that the director simultaneously present himself as an extremely annoying and heavily flawed character
i say unfortunately ,
election seems a bit of a disappointment .
and while election is an enjoyable piece of cinema ...
and lot of bad guy .
election has a great ensemble cast with well thought out performance
that are both subtle and impacting .
there really are not any weak link in the acting
that they are watching real gangsters.although the performance are great
a great
or if director johnnie to would have funneled down the necessary element and expounded on them more .
this is a wonderfully utal film with a great cast
excellent direction
it is actually hilariously awful.first off ... nicholas cage
i have enjoyed labute 's early film and a few of his play ...
he has.i would give this film a 2/10 solely
until you have seen the final 15 minute of the movie and its dreadful epilogue
just because it is so dreadful .
it is written so badly
it is poorly cast
let 's give nick some ridiculous dialogue about baring yourself in the hallway ...
the execution is dreadful .
it.the story itself was incredible
like most great movie it was looked over by the academy with a host of nomination but no win .
is definitely one of the best film of all time .
but sharp solid direction
excellent dialogue
and great performances.my favourite - big pussy from the sopranos
novak 's vulnerability was excellent .
ewan bremner is arguably one of the worst actor in the world at this time
( witness his performance in the god awful life of stuff )
and his `` cockney '' accent is almost as bad as his edinburgh accent .
avoid .
this movie was totally lame .
the worst part of it is morgana `` ursula 's crazy sister ''
which is ridiculous
overall it is a terrible waste of time .
somebody could probably make a great documentary about the jerry springer show ,
there are dozen of famously bad movie
witless waste of film.seriously
are you tired of stupid girl dialog 'oh my god '
so not only are not they scary but it is obnoxious .
it is fun
if i were to put prom night on the list of worst film of 2008
if it gets released on dvd for cheap and quick .
seriously do not spend your money or the time for dull acting
cheap scare
what a poor decision i had made going out seeing this movie .
the line were horrible to the point
very poor editing.all in all this movie was a giant waste of time and money .
making the white professor look stupid .
this is an excellent movie .
i recommended everyone to go see this movie .
this excellent drama had me in suspense the whole time .
the only bad cast member was the actress
the actress did a great job ,
but did have a very good cast filled with excellent
too bad after such a potent scene the film just seemed to talk and talk
i was stupid enough to rent it and boy ,
while seeming to be boring and mundane ,
are actually quite funny ,
the joke are subtle enough
he was a great actor .
this lesser-known movie is where cage gives one of his best performance .
but is one of my favorite movie of all time .
( who also is great in the movie )
you will not be disappointed .
the story is poor
the dinosaur costume are so poorly made ,
it does not waste too much of your life ,
but still try to avoid it altogether .
`` hmm ... this is not so bad ! ''
i loved the cable guy ,
that my big fat independent movie was great .
the main character is simply annoying ,
i have never found charley chase very funny ,
whom i find very funny .
that his very best film
that the very early and very crude 'married to order ' just is not funny at all.chase
oliver hardy gives the best performance in this film as her blowhard father ,
sadly
will rate 'married to order ' just 3/10 ,
i have seen him better but also worse .
it is not excellent
dane and beckinsale are perfect in the role
but sometimes that fun can get her into trouble .
brokedown palace is excellent
it heightens and complimants the mood of the film to perfection .
it or not the music is a perfect catalyst for reflection on this subject .
that does the lyric and her voice is beautiful and haunting
was some of the stupidity
that the prison they were in was all that bad .
that here.overall this is a great film
the plot is stupid .
the acting is the worst ever for most of the principal and frankly person
it was wonderful ,
the photography was beautiful.this movie made me do more research into this character archie belaney
if you are like me and enjoy a beautiful story
i mean her whole guideline of this show is stupid .
i enjoyed flavor fl av more better ,
how much money is she getting to do this awful show ,
but it also carries a message.a good film again from korea .
boring stuff we got here .
eh.. the last half hour is alright the rest is boring and not funny =
but the pace of this movie is pretty slow and sadly not funny .
just plain boring klayman running into each other
the fantastic scenery at hokkaid\u00f4
the excellent storytelling and last not least the wonderful soundtrack provide a rare intimacy with the protagonist .
completing a noir cycle at twentieth century fox ,
a shaken dixon does his best to cover it up ,
the blame fall on paine 's father-in-law
and will wait for him.it was great
gary merrill is great as the low-life scalise ,
and funny as morgan 's unjustly accused pop.a watchable film noir with a fantastic cast .
the visual were great .
simply beautiful .
to create visually arresting stuff and ice age is great to look at with its stylized visual .
but its a good solid movie its has good car chase scene ,
the ending is great just a good fair movie
but in just an absolute dull way for over two hour .
it was pointless
a true disappointment ... maybe
this film can best be compared to aki kaurism\u00e4ki 's drifting clouds ,
the best thing about les convoyeur attendent is the acting by poelvoorde .
the entire cast is funny
the best part to this film
were the subtle bit of humor
who looked even slightly ethnic for this romp.to make matter worse ,
not fun .
this one just fell way short.2/10
and for better or worse
which are aggravated by the haunted water of montana 's beautiful stream and river ...
and tommy noonan were hyped as 'the new lewis and martin ' is just shy of dreadful :
and their timing is nigh unto perfect
he is wasted in this film .
it also would have been much funnier
but it wears it with dignity.this film is still great fun .
and is huge fun in a part
was inherently amusing due ti its never being his greatest strength.the colour is fine ,
( amazing oscar nominated debut for maria full of grace )
but when he is ready to leave with the beautiful mistress ,
that i will return to my favorite film again and again .
steve buschemi is my absolute favorite .
even the most comprehensive and useful tourist guide would not help a tourist avoiding doing the wrong thing in a foreign country .
i would not have wasted my time renting it in the first place .
left behind is one of the worst film i
this would have been a perfect movie for elvis .
gary busey is once again perfect in a not so perfect role .
music as ordinary and dull as the script ) .
wasted on the other element .
wasted .
even though the plot was highly predictable .
quite bored with the cheap thrills.the plot
even though predictable ,
says jack_skellington_freke on the message board .
how dull.3/10 .
you have had amazing film ,
''the sentinel '' is one of the best horror movie
everything was great in her life ,
it is also horrible to see that she needs to become blind in the end of the movie
and more info on technique is available then ever beforethe sound in this movie is plain bad .
the atmos is equally terrible .
which are the result of poor sound editing .
the sound inside car is awful ,
the sound of car door closing is awful .
how can a movie with so many fundamental flaw be considered for award and high praise ?
the best creative output
not.my theory is that chile 's more selective and better talent avoided this film like the plague maybe due to its risqu\u00e9 content .
of course film critic rarely pay attention to technical detail
the film has all the production quality of a cheap tarantino
'' is excellent .
but also happy.all the character are great to me
great acting and a lot of dialog
something to avoid
that is bad ,
overwrought and tedious.there are some very fine english film available with content similar to this film .
`` nil by mouth '' is an excellent
and are never dull.spawned from his frustration over the savage notices his early film received
and an even worse jab
max seed is too nondescript and boring to leave an impression ,
ultimately resembling a washed-up pro wrestler doing `` the toolbox murder '' on a succession of equally boring victim .
seed 's character and boll 's `` message '' run contrary to one another :
and watching pointless stop-motion scene of decomposing animal and person
beautifully shot
is not this film 's strong point.indeed strong point are sadly lacking .
the gore ranges from the poor to the unnecessarily over gory whilst the sub-gollum nutter is never really fully explained
does have is some beautifully staged operatic aria
the great caruso won an oscar for sound recording
unfortunately due to contractual obligation
helping to popularize the great caruso.if
if you are looking for a great artist singing at the height of his career ,
than you should not miss the great caruso .
if disappoint at this not being a funny movie
someone 's previous comment complained about a boring trial .
the denouement is great .
that life on that street will never be the same.my favorite kind of character-driven flick :
zany and fun comic ride .
but definitely more fun .
that the romantic sub-plot was a waste of time
i loved this movie .
in fact i loved being an actress in this movie .
louisiana i loved this movie .
in fact i loved being an actress in this movie .
rich and subtle nuance float over her face .
-- josh flitter 's superb timing notwithstanding
and she pulls it off beautifully .
it is the best movie of its kind in decade .
the animation was actually excellent
the best being anne-marie ,
especially voiced by the wonderful vic tayback
unfortunately
however the biggest flaw was the rather bland song and the way
7/10 .
however mason prove to be much harder prey then the usual target in this ridiculous and slow paced actioner
which i would never get sick of watching.excellent viewing and full mark to the bbc for such a illiant series and the casting.first rate in all department
one of the worst movie i have ever seen .
made on the cheap :
character study is totally undermined by the predictable factor .
borrowing very liberally from `` a beautiful mind '' ,
person will give you bad look .
very very cool stuff.it was fun
because it is fun this
is a very fun movie .
that cheap trick was the band
i never tire of this fantastic movie .
the soundtrack is beautifully varied and fitting ;
i found it to be quite fun and entertaining .
it is full of extreme facial close-up and beautiful color shot of caravan of horse crossing the desert ,
charle boyer - not usually one of my favorite - is actually pretty good in this ,
a very enjoyable film .
the actor are great ; peter o'toole and susannah york
the movie feel like a pointless and obsolete one
and simply does not work out.the editing is simply dreadful and time
and it becomes even laughable bad in certain sequence .
project.really not worth your time.4/10
ernest borgnine was so wasted in this movie.there was no point
in putting this great actor in this movie.one of the greatest actor in the world wasted ,
what a disappointment !
i hated the mummy but this one was even worse !
out became a total disappointment .
though this movie is cheesiness at its best ,
if you must - i blame my wife for this )
this movie is a perfect
foregoing the insult
and i find it funny .
finally the bad latin stereo type are over !
this show is probably one the best i have seen ,
it is funny
bad movie ! .i forced myself to watch this all the way
otherwise it sucked.the kid was terrible ,
( weakly )
it made a bad movie even worse .
do not waste your time on this one .
it was very refreshing to see
it was amazing.go buy this film
and includes many annoying element .
because it was done poorly ,
it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience ;
i would advise you to not waste your time on the '60
that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of bob dylan 's music .
this film opened to poor showing in the first few week .
rated ghulam mohammad as one of the best composer
( a great personal friend ) .
terrible
terrible batman :
i was in for another hideous short from what so-far looked like another bad wannabe film-maker
but was instead greeted with a greatly put together trailer for a movie
probably because of bad editing .
great movie ,
even worse :
is ridiculous .
this is a stupid remake ,
and decide the best way
but is so rude and obnoxious
it is ainless and non-existent storyline and even worse the terrible and amateurish acting by everyone in it .
with an amazing amount of moxie
but it soars with a spirit of adventure besting even the space program
wonderful .
it is an amazing page-turner and the perfect setup for the newsreel-style movie .
cast was great .
he was actually great in his role
this is edited badly
why are these person the best choice for the type of experimenting
the acting is pretty bad .
the awful wallpaper
is the best movie bio ever .
that were cut.this masterpiece takes you from elvis childhood through his emergence as entertainment 's greatest star .
are excellent as elvis ' parent .
this enjoyable minor noir boasts a top cast
will do '' policy - my other favorite is greta garbo
he would have been great in boyer 's role or at least in francen 's
which is beautiful
is also because of the great music harry-gregson william with lisa gerrard
everything here is perfect.first - acting .
denzel washington is at his best
great radtha mitchell and amazing young dakota fanning .
which is dazzling and along with superb editing ,
and is pure beautiful .
no ridiculously ill placed humour
this is not the greatest film ever made ,
jame cagney is best known for his tough character- and gangster role
that he was not bad at it .
who was perhaps among the best and most successful director within the genre .
his musical were always light and fun to watch and more comedy like than anything else really .
that of course is also predictable
it nevertheless is a fun and simple story
a recommendable early genre movie.8/10
it is laughable ... there are hundred of them
i am running through my mst3k dvd collection again
but `` hobgoblin '' is a whole 'nother ballgame.the worst part of it all may be that it is now about 12 hour
enjoyable feature for both child and grown-up .
unfortunately
and worse ,
that his overall contribution is unremarkable at best .
similarly wasted are loni anderson
this movie was terrible !
it was a bomb.the acting was bad
to kill the monster.just plain bad do not even waste your time .
( 1/10 )
that have no understanding or experience with deployment or the military.person with military background or knowledge of the military will be disappointed with the inaccuracy .
this is actually an insult to the victim and their family of the btk killer .
do not even waste your time
jim henson 's muppet were a favorite of mine since childhood .
it is a waist to indulge such great actor in such a weak and boring movie .
he wears.one of the good wallace film from the 1960 's it is a solid little entertainment .
it would make an interesting double feature with the excellent earlier film.between 6 and 7/10 .
i was not disappointed in what i saw ;
then find a better script and budget.the special effect were so bad ,
as well as pixar 's made these laughable ,
that it could quite possibly be the worst movie ever .
bad acting
bad cinematography
bad sound
stupid character .
to be the most laughably bad movie i
it was so bad ,
scary movie 2 is definitely the worst of the 4 film ,
bad acting
pretty tedious and some really cheesy joke .
historical accuracy are terrible .
i rather enjoyed this episode .
and to make matter worse
it is a powerful message
with a great performance .
is one of her best effort ;
9/10 .
is a slightly unsettling and rather fascinating experience .
funny thing is that the movie by those director i was thinking
ren\u00e9e soutendijk is pretty amazing as the leading lady
( in a subtle way ) .
prove again what an excellent actress she is .
i also had fun with it
and that is the fun part :
de vierde man is a very much recommended viewing indeed
( especially if you enjoy a solid european psychological horror film ) .
.joki is truly true-to-life beautiful film of one saturday afternoon in a little village/town.the actor are maybe not so handsome or beautiful
that gives so-called `` art film '' a bad name .
though i am perfectly willing to admit
that it is a mess .
that funny here and the film is more than less a remake of the crappy 80 's classic `` santa claus the movie ''
but this time he ends up more annoying than likable
but she is not much of a character at all other than a neurotic joke and poor kevin spacey ends up basically playing the same person
and you can not blame him and rachel weisz ,
a major disappointment .
it is deadly unfunny .
the most amazing aspect of `` lady ... '' is the berserk casting .
the saddest note is to see wonderful claire bloom and barbara sukowa completely miscast and offensively wasted .
if you want to see how to accomplish a really bad film out of a really bad script with a berserk casting director ,
- 1/10
the incredible transformation of the bow of the sunken 'titanic '
including best picture ,
the visual effect are amazing ,
i just enjoyed many of the joke and scene present in this movie .
steve carell is perfect as the virgin nerd andy stitzer and i think
the romantic relation between the two main character is so beautiful
the visual are beautiful too .
the action is great
birthplace of the world 's best action movie .
absolutely recommended .
even the cover of the dvd looks cheap ,
some of the worst actor i\u00b4ve seen in my life
if you\u00b4re tired and want a cheap laugh ,
since i had loved the inspector gadget cartoon in the 80 's ,
i wasted my money .
great acting
one of the best thriller out there today !
why it was unforgettable .
while this film certainly does possess the stench of a bad film ,
and because he was by far the worst actor in the film .
is considered one of the worst film of the 1950s.a second reason
the acting is bad
and the background is poorly projected behind them .
horrid continuity and mindlessly bad dialog abounds throughout the film
this would be a perfect example for a film class
it is fun to laugh at and short
so it is worth a look for bad film fan .
the cast vary from bad till even worse.the great austrian comic han moser is wasted .
but may be the original editing was bad as well .
it is kinda pointless to make remark about the show ,
the bad choice were all over the place !
baz lurhmann gets no `` best director '' nomination !
`` a beautiful mind '' is up for `` best make-up '' ? ? ? ?
the movie was awful ,
that will go down as one of the greatest moment
is much more fun .
thing have a funny way of happening
this film also has great music ;
a few of my favorite song are 'silence ' by delerium
a cheap
it contains laughable effect
lame dialog
( funny how many of the kid from 90210 are doing cheap tv movie now )
they gave him a ridiculous wig and an unconvincing accent ,
forgettable .
that night of the twister was horrible ,
but it was far from great .
mediocre at absolute best .
except worse and with mundane special effect.i have nothing against the actor
even if they were not great ,
but the rest was more than disappointing .
but we can hear the fat sizzling in the flame.i do not want this sort of garbage
it is the best of all possible world .
though one of them is not entirely unsympathetic .
nightmare weekend stars a cast of ridiculous actor with even less of an idea
and even the sound is terrible .
but it has disappointed me and my friend
( a bad comedy ) .
that can save the movie.. india has been shot beautifully .
very well but could have been done much much better..animation is the worst i have seen in recent movie
i enjoyed it as a well mounted portrayal of the necessity of ingenious mind and ave body in the fight against crime .
were fun to watch .
this movie was terrible .
many of the actor and actress were not very great .
that were supposedly `` funny ''
were really stupid .
this movie should receive the worst possible rating
if you want to waste some time .
it is really bad tv .
it is bad both for artistic and reason financial reason .
moh is bad ;
be confusing or boring .
very bad ) ,
great director of photography like dean cundey
the `` master of horror '' is quite a lame approach to tv horror .
if not worse .
it gets boring and even annoying incredibly fast
but it is getting worst and worst with every episode :
and it is funny how they are starting to have complete unknown director
this third installment has higher production value and greater subtlety in both the acting and the story .
chasing after a group of really stupid person ,
it has to be bad
some of their line were funny ,
but really enjoyed it .
but not too much for the weak stomached.not for person
definitely the worst movie i have ever seen ...
drawn from the worst cabaret tradition ,
but the lowest mark was 1/10
is poorly made ,
the acting bad and the cinematography just a bit overdone .
but it only gets worse ,
combined with bad acting ,
but why waste my time .
and i am very disappointed.1/10 is for colin 's sweet little mustache in the end of the film .
i would given it 2/10 .
she is a wonderful actress
but this is an unfortunately unbalanced performance
do not really want to blame miss bening or most of the other performer
i felt so sorry for the wonderful jill clayburgh saddled with a cartoon bag lady costume and wig trying vainly to wrench something of significance from sketchy and clich\u00e9d dialogue .
they are great actress
that mr. muller has had a terrible time in his native land
that is housing one of the worst exponent of that philosophy.the film offer excellent acting all around .
mr. lukas does a great job portraying kurt muller ,
that made him a stage luminary on broadway.the other best performance
either that or it was just traumatisingly bad or both .
this movie is an excellent film ,
i would be shocked to see any child under the age of 8 not completely terrified throughout a great deal of the latter half and some of the first half of the movie ,
and assume are bad does not make the movie itself bad ;
good funny movie are supposed to make us laugh ;
are the `` closeness '' of victim and bad guy ...
a scan not 8/10
it was amazing the first time i saw it
and its amazing now .
the play control is perfect ,
the graphic are beautiful ,
it is great there is a show out there
and really make it great to watch .
and just enjoy the ridiculous part
great timing
he is great ,
i love adam the best .
that is disappointing ,
i am still trying to get back the couple hour i wasted on it.let me leave
that substantially more talented person waste away in community theatre and karaoke bar
and cut cds.much of the failure of this movie was the pathetic no-talent
were one of the best
and it won george burn an oscar for best supporting actor .
some of it was funny
that aside this was fun .
burn is just great tossing off one-liner with ease
their verbal battle are the best sequence in the movie .
-- not great .
although it seems pointless .
but the entire movie is congruously ridiculous .
this movie was long and boring .
it is just a long boring shot .
who creates some absolutely beautiful piece of art
the best film in history
stylish visual direction and excellent photography keep the movie mostly interesting throughout the two hour and eighteen minute length .
the lead actor are uniformly excellent .
the two weakness are the story and the fight scene .
great film
but the promised fight scene are disappointing .
his acting is great
i rated this film 7/10
which is an average of 8/10 for screenplay
direction and 1944 production value and 6/10 for acting.my acting rating in turn was calculated at 4/10 for all the screen character
who was excellent at 8/10.also i commend thomas gomez as inspector burgess
one of the best in his career.jessica lange is letter-perfect
and chemistry i have seen in a screen couple.john hurt gives his best snotty aristocrat performance.tim roth portrays one of the great screen villains.his rape of mary is repugnant
and harrowing.he really is a magnificent bastard in this movie.the final duel between rob and cunningham is one of the best swordfight ever.well scripted an scored ,
10/10 .
the plot is an absolute mess ,
this one is awful .
and still come out worse than any roger corman movie !
but declined due to the poor quality of the script !
bad-movie-merchandising-made-into-a-worse-game-in-two-weeks-and-then-shippe d-out-and-bought-by-morons-and-their-parents-for-christmas horrid .
the graphic were boring .
the monster were boring .
the level were boring .
the interface was boring .
this was a boring game .
the home version was even worse !
while you were being bored silly by this pointless game !
which may explain the tedious use of matrix-style effect .
that made this entire experience remotely enjoyable
that everyone in the theatre was making fun of the movie out loud ,
all creature great and small is going to be !
seriously - avoid this movie at any cost .
and although i paid non-refundable money for it ,
and i lived through some pretty bad ones.it is one of those film
( and badly so )
simplest and cheapest joke in the book .
while high - all badly written and acted ) ,
you might actually find these genuinely funny ,
so it had lame joke
( delivered badly ) ,
was badly dubbed and edited \u0096
who can be a lot less funny zan zee german .
but do not watch this awful flick .
and thought possibly it might be a cheap tvm
with real special effect from the best of hollywood .
avoid this movie at all cost .
see this only for study of how bad can be a movie ... ... ... ... ... .
sadly
and we are forced to focus on irena carter 's bland character
boring
every premise for a great movie was accomplished .
without suspense and awfully predictable .
that combines perfectly fabulous special effect and great plot.after starship trooper
in stead of a great film
-- - it is too predictable .
perfect victim for bacon.
absolutely horrible. -- -
what was supposed to be a great movie
4/10
that is not a bad thing.anyway ,
if you enjoyed david fincher 's the game ,
because of the near unanimous bad review .
nick nolte was horrible ,
( and that is no fun ,
as the worst superhero movie ever.but then something happened .
about 3/4 of the way through this tedious movie
this was one of the best action
but what about the incredible hulk ?
guess what ... it is boring too !
the cgi in this movie is horrible .
the incredible hulk looked positively ridiculous .
actor or cinematographer ever could.worse ,
the incredible hulk was slightly more fast-paced ,
but there is absolutely not a single scene in the incredible hulk
the cartoonish cgi is an insult to the audience - at least in ang lee 's version
bad sf movie become good comedy
the ridiculous conception of mar as a planet so alien
it is never boring
only to make it all sound more and more ridiculous ) ,
is ridiculous .
the entire film was a boring
stupid
mess .
this is the worst horror film i have seen in year .
she is a bad actress !
that would be an insult to the talent of barbie !
stupid movie !
-- but i never in my wildest dream expected something so extremely extremely terrible .
the sound is crap the picture quality goes from bad to worse to good to bad again !
poor film making aside ,
absolutely ridiculous .
the thing i respect about most of my favorite b-rated movie are
complete with poor attempt at poignant line and dumb camera shot .
i still gave it 4/10 star ,
any better than this one did.my all-time favourite ''bad guy '' has to be oliver reed as bill sike .
was fantastic ,
the music is fantastic
carol reed did an excellent job of nancy 's sticky ending ,
but it was clear about 30 second in that this was either david lynch or something seriously terrible .
interesting to watch just to run through the fundamentalist laundry list .
the message seems to be
well ... the movie was a fun watch .
and the zombie were just fun to watch .
all in all you can not expect schindler list but its a fun watch .
it was worse on the second time !
did the above 3/10 viewer actually watch the movie ? ? ?
it was so stupid .
that scene was so ridiculous.-too long for its own good ,
who was satisfactory at best .
as being the second best dirty harry movie yet ,
who thankfully grants the movie its only thespian-related redeeming feature .
with a weak story
and should be stricken from the playlist of even the most mundane and timid glb movie festival.amazingly for a pseudo-indie release
avoid it and you will not be missing out on anything good.rating : * *
played wonderfully by walter matthau ,
this movie is cute and fun ... a `` feel-gooder '' !
liza minelli did a wonderful job as the side kick -
my favorite scene is when arthur is visiting his fianc\u00e9e 's house .
`` arthur is truly `` funny stuff '' !
it is a very poorly produced product .
i feel deeply disappointed .
synthesizer generated uninspired score of lame `` period '' inspired romantic karaoke insults the viewer ears on more than one occasion .
but overall it is pretty lame and two-dimensional production in more than one way with no flash of genius from either the director or any member of the crew .
this movie is terrible
this is a great film
the lighting was horrible in some place ,
not a bad movie for fan of the b-movie genre ,
that the film itself is virtually pointless .
of showing long and drawn-out re-enactment scene ... dark angel is not a horrible film -
then you need to seek treatment anyway ... 4/10
probably the worst dolph film ever .
do not waste your time .
the character is just plain stupid and stumble around aimlessly .
pointless .
is dismally bad ,
it is almost funny ,
the script is poorly written
and the dialogue verge on just plane stupid .
is absolutely laughable.if
avoid this at all cost .
when i finally watched i was not disappointed.this movie has some altman-like flavor
is simply beautiful and inspiring .
this is one of the most overlooked gem hollywood
when a messanger is sent to ask the pilot to accompany him to heaven
as fantastic as it seems ,
the final scene is simply beautiful
this film is in my personal all-time favorite top 10 ,
and his lame con-man sidekick
to win a best picture oscar.jon voigt
befriended by a lame con-man
this is the very definition of milking a great and inventive original movie ...
i loved ellen burstyn 's performance
she is fantastic !
it was just so beautifully done .
this is the most messed up entry on imdb
i am afraid this one is pretty dreadful ,
bad lighting
poor audio
more than cancel out her excellent performance in `` new waterford girl '' .
to insert a lazy and lame `` deus ex machina '' device toward the end is hardly a surprise .
still it could be worse ,
i loved this movie
it was so touching and beautiful .
monster - he was great ;
i loved the special-effect
and it is very tedious .
a typical `` do not pollute the water '' message
- a horrible mutated monster .
was mostly stupid .
but this was not funny .
as the korean guttural voice sound got annoying
but turned out to be a big letdown and even boring in too many spot ,
the preview made the film look awful .
it had some very funny moment in it and although flawed is an effective satire on the show and the person on the show
mainly by the awful soundtrack of bludgeoning 'comedy ' effect
and it would be proclaimed 'the worst film ever made ' .
the film is shot beautifully
it features an arrangement of great character
all in all 8/10 great plot character
another woo 's masterpiece ! this is a best wuxie film i am
his movie like the great poetry !
which fits perfectly with the image .
multiple exposure of the dancer represent the patient ' point of view and their confused `` view '' of the world.these are just two example from this amazing film
the vulnerable doctor falls for the career badman ,
and loved it .
from start to finish.the plot is so weak ,
i am getting in a bad mood
do not watch this movie.life 's to short to waste it on watching crappy movie .
loved the film !
both of which are two of my favorite .
poor michael madsen ; he must be kicking himself to know
folk have found out about this horrible flick .
i really can not think of anything worse i have ever seen
bad script
walsh and laura flyyn boyle are the perfect pair
cage excel at what he does best-
( mantegna is superbly charismatic ) .
that dr. ford is not a very sympathetic character ,
about the movie is that he wears a succession of funny hat .
this was a truly awful movie but in a bad way .
great kevin peter hall ,
if it was as bad as all that .
but the execution and the script is mediocre .
not the worst horror movie i have seen
( the best tv series today can hardly compete with these old moderately good serial . )
it is not stupid ;
stupid are those
unpretentious and friendly fun.without
.surprisingly ,
leads him to make serious error of judgement and to fail to recognise the need for any code of conduct
and to avoid fulfilling the low expectation
bad script
bad direction
almost as funny as `` spinal tap ''
i loved the idea of this film from the moment
( who exemplifies the worst of experimental psychology )
and you have pure fun.the film is filled with great character actor and delightfully sweet and daffy performance .
tim robbin is wonderfully endearing
is just as funny as matthau.matthau :
a refreshingly hilarious
juvenile and stupid ,
-- funny character
smart and funny dialogue
and grand entertainment.one of the best buddy comedy of all time
and also its fantastic
a good 90 % of the film move along perfectly .
perhaps not as subtle
and horse carry the story forward beautifully .
it belongs amongst the best film ever made .
which would have been great
some of the lip-synching is pretty poor ,
probably the worst film i have ever seen ,
the acting and story were terrible
the acting is awful ,
she was a wonderful voice for cinderella ; very appealing ; very believable .
the music really fit the movie perfectly .
the acting was great ;
loved the mice ! !
they were just awful .
the spoiled behavior very well.this is a wonderful movie ,
even her high-pitched voice got a bit annoying in here .
so-so at best and a sub-par ending for a great actress .
she is perfect .
it fails.then again ,
and is an example of some great work by a first time director .
but if you are not up on the latest stupid pop culture
why waste your time .
and have more fun than this movie will provide .
2/10 .
it was a great concept
that was ruined with a horrible script .
and was disjointed at best .
this made for a maddeningly boring watchit could have been so good :
that mental illness is not a terrible word anymore
she was great and always will .
she would be wonderful as a mentor to young person .
it is a very funny time pass
it is colourful and fun so on a boring sunday evening this will sure lighten your mood .
whoopi 's work as emcee was very funny
i personally loved her last apperance ,
and they are all beautiful and captivating .
the animation is also superb and the music captures the feeling in the film perfectly .
the movie also explores the love and disappointment
giving a subtle and laconic performance .
the movie 's only nod to political correctness.i give this movie a10/10 ;
in time it will be acknowledged as a great film .
this movie is a ridiculous farce of film-making .
person like you are a rare find .
and it is - unfortunately - worse
but also some awfully bad acting moment .
from the technical point of basic instinct 2 is a mediocre movie
for instance the scene of crazy joyride is done poorly .
the film looks cheap
and badly edited at time .
it had the best sharon stone 's performance in her career .
unfortunately basic instinct 2 is a unintentionally funny movie ,
badly directed and a sure razzie award winner in many category .
that it is was boring ,
2. this movie has the worst snowman joke ever .
the joke is so bad
lousy script .
acting not quite as bad as the writing ,
but still bad .
a much funnier film with this same exact idea is `` movie movie
sucks so bad.anyway ,
do not waste your 90 minute .
serious home alone/karate kid knock off with enough bad character stereotype to have the writer sued and then shot .
rather than fighting i get a lot more fun out of it
and this film is one of the best in term of fantastical plotting and crazy flying shenanigan .
the great
perhaps best off all is joey wang as the fox spirit
giving every forest scene a wonderfully bewitching atmosphere .
this is a beautiful piece of entertainment
highly recommended .
after seeing the whole film for the first time i rate it as a 7/10
to become an 8/10 .
the sci-fi channel has made some bad `` original '' movie ,
this might possibly be their worst so far !
this badly written and directed `` jurassic park '' rip-off offer all the usual clich\u00e9s
who 's only function in the film
is to die a horrible death
the special effect are atrocious\u0097the puppet head in close-up of the title beasty are bad enough ,
but the cgi\u0097which makes the computer-generated dinosaur in `` walking with dinosaur '' look life-like by comparison\u0097are just downright awful .
and the death scene of the scientist at the end is truly one of the worst thing
it was so bad !
do not waste your time ,
this one is just downright bad.2/10 .
unfortunately ,
poor howard so stuck on his spielbergian knockoff quality
too bad for howard
is just awful .
that makes sense to him and john torturro expresses this in a beautiful fashion
unfortunately i doubt
i enjoyed cut thouroughly .
a genre normally restricted to the mainstream hollywood film.with all the usual cooky comedy and dramas coming out of australia i loved
i enjoyed it .
the child loved it
apart from its beautiful and striking animation
combined with the skill and artistry of some of disney 's best animator .
) this film is funny
clever and great fun for the whole family !
it is best to go to your dentist
then it is best not to watch this
the dentist has the best bloody revenge in it that i have ever seen .
the best cheech and chong movie so far ! !
of all the cheech and chong this is most certain the best so far .
but this is most definitely the best .
because they still are great comedian .
it is a rather bland and flat performance .
we have the worst ever sound effect
but in that annoying way .
an actually not-so-bad story
and overall execution of the plot are weak .
( too bad fox was not around in 1985 ) .
that is simply bad ,
it is certainly a horrifying proposition to waste your time watching this crap .
( usually dull and illogical )
you would soon get tired of the resulting pointless plot .
the plot ends up being incoherent and stupid .
are all wonderful .
the script is snappy and fun and the overall production value quite high .
this is truly the greatest swedish movie of all time .
the whole time.while it is not a 'must see ' or a great film by any standard ,
the screenwriter poorly attempted to re-create the `` exorcist ' .
extremely boring
this movie did horrible in the movie theater
lame concept
making the movie become pathetic and delusional about how dark and intelligent
a ridiculous movie like hulk is a cinematic masterpiece ) .
if you want mind-numbingly boring horror ,
the dynamic between the person are what makes it both funny and sad .
my favorite scene is the one
even if it is hilariously funny !
serb humor at it is best !
hopelessly inept and dull movie
when the heroine carefully winds the octopus like tentacle of a flesh eating plant around her before weakly thrashing about
how awful the end result was ,
it is a weak script ,
it is best seen
sort of mindless fun .
there is something less than solid here .
which was full of disappointment and regret .
a confused mess from start to finish .
there was a secret message
and the two cardinal sin of any bad movie carried from start to finish .
a non-existent and pathetic story line
and by far the worst
scott does an incredible job as scrooge .
buy your ticket to the festival of bad movie aka sundance.what a sad waste .
i find this film a beautiful shown example of a severe psychic trauma
it is actually fun to watch .
corbin bernsen gives a surprisingly non-lackluster performance as a crazed dentist
i guess is the absolute worst
the set design is superb and without gloss .
the early career of abe lincoln is beautifully presented by ford .
is beautiful
any resemblance is remote at best.my only qualm with the king of mask ,
it was weak
cliche and about as subtle as a sledgehammer .
highly recommended .
the lord of the ring was a great adaptation of the story
and ice is a great achievement from bakshi from an animation point of view .
you still get some of the dull still-cell and slightly blurred background painting
here it enhances the film 's unique atmosphere.unfortunately the film fails
and tigra especially sounds really terrible
it is still a hella cool and really funny .
that this film ison of the director 's best .
ben gazzara is excellent as the head detective persuing audrey hepburn
this film has some great performance by a supurb cast .
and colleen camp has one of her best role as the manic country singer christy miller .
highly recommended !
\u0096 it is a great part :
and those are his great character name ,
fortunately the music is so great ,
if brando and simmon had not been in it with their wonderful chemistry ; brando 's unpredictability ; simmon ' face
beautiful .
all character are cast and portrayed excellently .
along with the incredibly weak plot line in the movie ,
this movie was nothing but a disappointment .
although it had great actors/actress ,
i was pretty disappointed in what i believe was one of audrey hepburn 's last movie .
i will always love john ritter best in slapstick .
some film can get by with a weak
plot with superb acting
the dialogue was at best mediocre ,
want a great recipe for failure ?
add in some weak ,
completely undeveloped character and than throw in the worst special effect
this is not one of those bad movie
and make fun of .
boring
sad waste of time .
corpse grinder ii is the biggest waste of energy and talent i have ever seen .
when you have poor direction ,
you have shown me what is truly awful ,
that are merely crappy or boring .
this could well be the worst film i
it starts badly
we have hitler 's father cursing his own bad luck on the `` fact ''
when he catches up with the poor thing
this movie was extremely poorly conceived from every angle except technological .
he is not bad ,
he is not bad ,
which really is not funny and seems artificial at time ,
and the direction which is pedestrian to the port of dullness .
but otherwise this is just a disappointment .
funny thing is
they are extremely fun to watch ,
and rarely going out for `` meat '' or human to eat .
one of the best tarzan films is also one of its most action packed
its an amazing film by almost any standard .
best of all its the sort of film
its an amazing thing.i really like this film a great deal.if there are any flaw to the film ,
this is one of the great adventure .
this was 94 minute of jaw-dropping horribleness !
an otherwise excellent flick ) .
and the rest of the cast was worse ,
worse than the acting
a cad and user of woman with no redeeming quality whatsoever .
some great sublime transcendental stuff amongst some of the most horrible trash i have ever seen .
this film is an obvious attempt by renoir
an amazingly intimatelook at too eccentric
she is stillbeautiful and full of life.in grey garden ,
she made decade ago isone of the film best scene ) ,
lar von trier creates a noir atmosphere of post-war germany utterly captivating .
just wonderful .
i was so disappointed
some great thing can come out of such a little country ,
is incredible .
i was very disappointed
and the clip of their past were poorly edited
became a waste of my $ 1 credit at the video store .
uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a handsome but bland adaptation ,
the film does a solid job
and bill pullman is perfect as their sleazy lawyer .
`` the straight story '' is a truly beautiful movie about an elderly man
dreadful
dreadful movie ...
only without the benefit of being funny ...
crummy action scene and bad
bad acting .
i find it kind of fascinating in its badness ...
this is the second adaptation of `` beowulf '' i have been disappointed with in a year .
that one was only a little disappointing .
this one is a mess ! ! !
pointless love interest ?
even worse was the way
they made beautiful marina sirtis look so horrible ! ! !
and lets not even talk about that ridiculous crossbow ?
you will be infinitely disappointed by this dismal ,
fascinating
is so lame
it is funny .
and un-suspenseful it is funny .
not truly bad .
a 1/10 movie would .
it is not terrible enough
so it is a bad movie ,
but there are much worse one out there .
that i really enjoyed it ,
not a great movie ,
but an enjoyable one .
how bad it is .
who made this stupid movie
and they wasted much of my personal time
has a cast of loser and poor actor !
it was not that bad .
but for an indie slasher it is not that bad .
and it will not be that bad .
and lloyd kaufman 's cameo is wonderfully understated .
dick tracy is one of my all time favorite film .
this movie is amazing !
and the impressive acting make this film fantastic .
the film has bloodless violence and no bad language
this is one of the best character
she has the best one liner i have heard !
the film still lacks impact and believability .
almost everything else works out absolutely beautifully .
mostly enunciated in perfect and modern and highly understandable voice -
julie christie as gertrude is surely one of the best ever ,
`` this is terrible !
but it is a funny story -
and it made a great impression on me ,
i must pronounce branagh 's hamlet to be my favorite one
10/10 for an absolutely tremendous hamlet .
are all cavorting around a post-apocalyptic barren wasteland wreaking all sort of mayhem .
`` now i like the occasional terrible movie ,
i rated this film a solid `` 1
( awful ) '' --
because it is one of the most legitimately dreadful effort at movie-making i
given that marvelous title.so what is really `` good '' about this bad movie ?
or ridiculous fashion.exterminator of the year 3000 also has a fair supply of `` dialogue-so-bad-it-becomes-funny
provided in great part by crazy bull
shakespearean paraphrase and oddly pg-style insult are all
and that is terrific.despite its quality kill and bad dialogue
if you are looking for a truly entertaining bad movie ,
and bad dialogue
in which the audience is forced to follow the character in protracted and boring car `` chase '' and long desert hiking sequence ... all in all
a pretty good awful movie
but it certainly avoids the trap
of making this look like a boring tv soap in costume ,
however dornwinkle has perfected his invisibility serum
sorry coogan and tony marke is awful .
that just fails in every department .
the comedy is lame and every joke miss by the proverbial mile ,
is funny .
that too is lame .
dull
predictable
boring and has highly annoying and unlikable teenage character's.director rifkin or coogan or whatever does absolutely nothing
to try and make the invisible maniac an even slightly enjoyable experience .
unfortunately he was invisible at the time
because this is one seriously cheap looking film .
the invisible maniac is a poorly made film throughout
i found no redeeming features in it at all ,
there is no reason whatsoever to waste your time on this rubbish .
definitely one to avoid .
that turn out so annoying
combine the director of `` what the worst
unfortunately this film survived as yet another testament to canada 's inability
if the person lapping up these public fund had had to compete ,
whoopi goldberg gave her best screen performance by mile .
( otherwise best known as judas in the 1973 film of jesus christ superstar )
as preacher samuel.beautifully paced and sensitively written
slim slam slum is a sad and disappointing picture .
it is so bad
kind of disappointing since witnessing the character in action
and i looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast .
it was unbelievably predictable and just plain unfunny .
of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh ,
the reality was disappointing .
most of the action was predictable .
this is the worst film i
i consider the film an insult to my ain as well as my backside
but this is so bad i can not even believe it .
martin did a great job adapting a classic story into a comedy in `` roxanne '' ,
best to rent `` great expectation '' .
the plot and the character are perfunctory .
the more predictable ending would have been preferable to one
that is so bad .
perhaps the film maker saw how predictable the film was
that made the movie even worse.stay away .
is weak ,
in the worst role of a very inconsistent career )
this is the worst film
which is the best one-word summary i
that is great.i felt
and i *loved* the style
( music-wise 10/10 )
and he has done a remarkable job.the dialogue between ben and sam is just amazing.and
and then beats him with the stick.the movie is often very funny
that this was a b movie at best .
that the acting in all case was awful
it was ridiculously shallow
this movie did a great disservice to the cause .
awful
terrible
one does not get to enjoy this gem
it also contains some wonderful line .
i just saw it again and loved it .
and this is a great triumph for him
-- and for which he earned the best actor oscar .
it is a wonderful portrait of an actor losing his mind
though `` othello '' was an excellent choice
as colman had excellent support from signe hasso
the great george cukor was directing ,
it is a wonderful film from start to finish .
and it spawned one of the greatest sitcom on television .
7/10 .
so it can take its hallowed place as on of the greatest film of all time in ten to twenty year
is one of the most fascinating and artistic view of the bleakness and almost psychotic uncertainty
like you are watching some lost espionage noir classic from the late 1940 's with the perfectly lighted black and white scene ,
10/10
even at threat of great loss ,
meryl streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous lindy chamberlain
the film 's first half is driven by the excellent performance of dutton as reverend willie taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the family .
through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull
and downright awful 2nd half .
4/10 .
this movie reunites some of the best director from around the world such as gus van sant
in this film we also have one of the best cast
including such great actor like willem dafoe
gerard depardieu and many more each one with great performance .
of sitting through that piece of human waste
that uwe boll cranks out as the `` worst film ever made . ''
he has created the single most annoying and convoluted patchwork of a movie i
of the potential this plot would have had without the poorly written character ,
without the bad writing ,
and without all that unnecessary and unfunny comedy .
my best advice to those reading this would be to simply rent
movie is lousy .
it looked ridiculous.the color tone were way off .
this 'movie ' is poorly made
and poorly done.the plot - you got to be kidding .
do not waste your time or money on it .
i love columbo and have seen pretty much all of the episode but this one undoubtedly ranks as the worst of the lot .
a mind-bogglingly tedious
pointless
that wastes both the time of the viewing audience and of the acting talent of an exceedingly bored-looking peter falk .
( or possibly annoying )
as it sounds ridiculous ?
and all true columbo fan would do well to avoid it like the plague .
the movie was perfectly cast-with pollen and bellows especially-i was not that impressed with the book .
not fascinating and more confusing
annoying and depressing then anything else .
the movie is watchable and for some reason does not leave as bad a taste in your mouth as the book
it as absolutely incredible to me
and was intended to be a ave condemnation of hitler and the terrible suffering
it fails abysmally as a work of art.the only good performance here are from paul lukas ,
the child are ridiculously shown as robotically well-behaved little snip .
a great actress
his armature cast 's performance was superb .
but she did a great job as a naive girl
and it is funny seeing man with camera get all excited
albeit stupid at time
wonderful performance
yes some of the joke are stupid ,
i still remember the complete waste
unfortunately
and complete waste of time
a great deal of work and money has been put into a film
that is amateur at best.the editing drag on ,
michael keaton an excellent comic performer
who fares best at murdering the english language.i associate many childhood memory with this film ,
that even relays some well meaning message about the danger of smoking
but it is hard to recommend.7/10 .
the acting was so laughable
that would have helped me avoid this atrocity and frankly something
that movie this poor should be required
avoid this movie no matter what .
this film was boring .
he was boring ,
even though it fails on so many different level .
this movie is horrible- in a 'so bad
arguably his best .
you will be amazed at how such a wonderful film could go un-noticed .
you i was not disappointed .
different and funny story .
were all very funny and jon voight
most recommended !
because it was bad .
the writing was in fact embarrassingly bad .
-- as you learn in the really stupid and totally unconvincing conclusion .
usually the twist at the end makes the episode great
having to suffer through the rest of this senseless mess.honestly ,
there is also an excellent music score
definitely one of funny man eddie murphy 's lesser films is this nonsense about a kidnapped mystical child
( the comedy is not so great mind you ) ,
the movie fails on many level .
very silly and disappointing.sunday
it was funny in spot .
maybe its not that bad .
the acting was awful ,
the monster was the biggest disappointment of the movie .
3/10 .
poor parker .
most issue were treated with sensitivity and subtlety .
if you love those funny tale of love ,
as he is approached by various beautiful woman and handsome man
babs steele is undeniably beautiful .
it looks as synapse did a great job with picture enhancemant ,
that is less than perfect .
angela lansbury is extremely funny
but compare the dull visual effect of `` blithe spirit '' to the truly groundeaking effect in disney 's `` song of the south ''
when hearing quincy jone ' first note or seeing the wonderful color of purple of the flower in the meadow .
the whole cast gives the best performance in a film i
all give us their best
margaret avery is wonderful as shug avery ,
the director and the music makes this beautiful ,
that i have seen worse movie ,
but thats not the worst of it .
the plot is predictable .
if only to experience what has to be one of the biggest waste of a tiny budget ever .
this is a priceless example of a stupid movie !
happening horrible killing .
mediocre protagonist
excellent musical score taken from oman i and iii by the great jerry goldsmith .
the motion picture is badly directed by jorge montesi and dominique othenin girard .
it was a bit bizarre and evil and i enjoyed it a lot ,
the character in the show were great as well ,
to see it cut off.. i would have loved to see
it was great to something different on tv .
this is the most compelling and excellent performance
it even surpasses his wonderful performance as `` johnny eager '' coming a full 14 year after that film .
along the way charlie kills a family of indian and captures the beautiful dea pagent .
lloyd nolan as the drunken skinner is wonderful with his wise crack and accordian playing .
to make the great diva look good ,
even though this was one of streisand 's greatest box office hit ,
it is arguably her worst film
the filmmaker actually see esther as a sympathetic victim ;
just so the film can indulge in the lame racism
this movie is so great
if you want something really bad
or something lame like that )
perhaps a little too subtle for today 's youngster ,
is a perfect leisurely pastime of a story ,
this movie is great.now ,
which acts as a funny music video for 'bad ' and 'speed demon ' ,
it is passable.then we see the great video for 'leave me alone ' ,
the plot is laughable .
very laughable .
the amazing 'smooth criminal ' sequence.it is a so-so film ,
but it is fantastic for anyone
clara lago is wonderful as the title character of the film
the film is shot beautifully
who does a great job as carol .
because they are so beautifully developed ,
`` an albacore around my neck '' is my favorite of johnny boy .
macarthur is a great movie with a great story
about a great man general douglas macarthur .
this film would be of much greater significance to one familiar with both ww ii and the korean war .
peck 's portrayal of this great man
( which was great
but it strained my eyes.the movie also enjoyed playing trick on you \u0096 an interesting build-up gave me hope for the slow moving story
asian ' fascination with bodily fluid and a horrible music score
the average bland asian thriller.i just do not get
that still lurks amongst us \u0096 tetanus.4/10
this version of `` moby dick '' insults the audience by claiming
this is perhaps the greatest example of how far hollywood
and change a famous novel just to beef up its chance at the box office.all of the novel 's beautiful
the world is a terrible place .
every actor in this one had fun .
`` ... the best version ever '' .
but it is not bad .
the worst film i have seen for a long while .
worse ,
life of the saint lacks their innovation let alone their depth and shading .
that it received funding
'presque rien ' is a beautifully observed portrait of the experience of a young french homosexual .
it is a wonderfully naturalistic film ,
superbly acted ,
the dialog was bad .
the dialog was bad .
i was slightly disappointed in the series ,
and no matter how bad these movie are ,
he finances them all himself through some kind of bizarre german fund
complete failure is one of the great mystery of the universe.it would not be so bad
except that video game developer keep giving their best property to this guy .
when they make a bad movie out of a game
i would not be disappointed .
but that was fun to watch .
to show off this new technology in short bit of cartoon-like happening with beautiful color and imaginative scene .
stoner must have really loved this.it is a nice
but a bad
boring
and pointless movie .
that it 'was all just a mess ' ;
( rich and poor )
it is not that bad ,
characterisation is notably weak ,
although this dynamic works best
it rarely stems outside of the typical confine of the odd-couple formula.kate
and the remainder usually fell to shepard.it is a rare thing of course
sniper is by most account a very solid thriller ,
does surprisingly well
just random scene of ridiculous action .
the sixth installment of the nightmare on elm street series and once again another bad sequel .
that i am just getting more and more disappointed though with these sequel ,
this is one of the worst sequel ,
this just had bad acting
stupid editing ,
and just over all a bad idea for a story .
not father knows best.2/10
that it was one of the worst film i
although visually fascinating
it was pretty boring and disturbing
fails to deliver with this one ,
unfortunately
( though this has a valid plot reason later on ) .i would have loved to see some 1930s zombie attack helpless city folk ,
that could be a great one with a little script re-working
we get one of those gem performance from real pro .
the only over the top performance is from the always reliable eduardo cianelli as a mob boss with a messianistic complex .
and marjorie main is excellent
and gets her best role since `` dead end '' .my bid for this one is a second feature on a double bill with something like `` city for conquest '' .hooray for warner !
godawful ... the kind of film
where kader and anupam play the blind and deafthis movie is a tedious exercisethe film has joke of such nonsense that you do not feel like laughing like snehal dabi 's head getting stuck in the back of the horse and all those type comedy
which we do not laugh at now but mock the film starts off in a clich\u00e9d manner and some scene are funny sadly such moment do not last long
even the comedy gets boring the twist is well handled
you my angelvivek is awful in the comic scene ,
i can not even define its central message for myself.nevertheless ,
a sparkling film with a great cast
and enjoyed it immensely .
really bad .
and not in a mst3k kinda way.virtually unwatchable
as a couple of bozos do their best `` hip cat '' impression of abott and costello.chessecake can usually save cheesy sci fi
this movie was so horrible .
i am so glad i did not have to pay money to see this horrible movie .
but it was really bad .
it was really really bad .
it was completely ridiculous ,
and it you want to see a bad movie
all and all horrible movie
it might actually be on my top 10 worst film i
this is one of the most amazing story i
is a beautiful film ,
how many more of these god awful cheaply
( and badly )
but also a matching piece of eye candy and his annoying son.the supposed luxury cruise liner
( although even this film is so bad
it was a very bad year - even by hollywood standard .
the character and their relationship are so completely incredible and shallow
the plot is just pointlessly absurd rather than comically absurd ,
( and cheap )
it is not funny )
and is rather a very poor last work .
it is definitely one work in the great director 's canon
this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen .
otherwise it is a boring piece of work and the only reason i
ever 90 minute are a waste in this case ...
cruel intention 2 is bloody awful
i mean uber-bad .
how bad it is ,
it is poorly written
unfunny
and badly acted .
but in cruel intention 2 tried to make it funny and some of the idea in the film should not be ,
it should be avoid .
and tweety asked `` was it beautiful ?
it would make thing even worse .
it really was not as bad as i thought
who did the voice for frodo sounded somewhat like elijah wood.not the greatest adaptation of a book ,
i have seen a lot worse .
but this dreadful screenplay
which was predictable since the beginning of the film .
now a great artist can die in the arm of her great artist son ,
that the german film subsidy fund is not always producing good film ,
to fail so abysmally on both front ... .really awful .
nice movie with a great soundtrack
the story of cinderella is one of my favorite from charle perrault
enchanting masterpiece from disney.the film has a great soundtrack ;
my favorite song is the romantic
my favorite scene is the scene after the narration ,
diamantino costa is one of the best portuguese director ;
this title is starred by one of the best portuguese comedian of all time ,
herman jos\u00e9 and jos\u00e9 pedro gome are great .
its a very funny movie ! !
quite restrained and yet conveyed a oad spectrum of emotions.the ending is wonderful .
boom mic operation and other technical aspect of this film are laughable ,
unfortunately its not the only area .
that have been saved by their script great characterization and plot ,
this unfortunately has an awful script
awful acting and worst of all
awful annoying character .
fun and magical about my childhood .
and this made a great spot to pretend
no need to defend my opinion of these movie as some of the greatest of all time .
kick and incredible stunt .
the humour on the whole is pretty unsubtle ,
not complaining.the acting is not too subtle
i am not sure there was anything subtle about 'police story ' at all .
unfortunately the trailer is better than the movie ,
and i am totally disappointed with this dull and implausible collection of clich\u00e9s .
an excellent period murder melodrama
because fontaine is wonderful .
and also later penned the excellent script for the classic british horror film night of the demon .
played by the wonderful una o'connor
this was an incredibly bad idea ! !
the cast was excellent
the best thing about this film
but after the presentation i was total disappointed and furious .
was horrible .
that can belongs to the worst of the film\u00b4s history .
this romantic comedy is not too bad .
there are some funny thing happening here and there ,
while some scene are great fun ,
it is not really a bad movie ,
unfortunately ) .
it is poor writing ,
sloppy dialog and annoying moralizing make for a very slow film .
`` fungicide '' is quite possibly the most incompetent
who are simply too awful to write about .
really weak.i can not believe money was spent on this camcorder-shot rubbish .
that friend and family of the maker come onto imdb and post mendacious review and give stupidly high user rating
very stupid or very
kurt russel is my favorite actor so i think
that it should have more then a 5.6/10 on the meter
played by the ever fantastic tom savini ,
the character 's are poor ,
and the tom savini character is great
the acting is generally pretty poor save for savini
rather than acting.forest of the damned was a pretty poor horror film ,
it would be bad
i enjoy laughing at bad movie .
this is the worst sequel on the face of the world of movie .
the killer still kills for fun .
that it is the stupidest movie ever.do not watch this .
i enjoyed this movie .
and felt he fit this role perfectly .
it is fun to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual guidance .
this movie is by far the best film adaptation of his work .
one of the best true-crime movie ever made and very faithful to truman capote 's book
nancy clutter 's beloved horse
will geer has a great turn as the prosecutor in the short trial scene
this is a solid movie ,
this is just plain lame .
it is not even laughably bad like jolly roger or alien abduction
by the way are pretty bad ) .
this is just bad !
acting or lame special effect in an asylum movie ,
who was not a great director
considered one of her early great one .
bette davis was one of the greatest film actor ,
and he did it superbly .
he was a subtle and intelligent
and it is fun to watch .
misty munda 's makeup is bad in this movie
this is one of the best movie i
as well in my opinion.some of my favorite part of the movie were the opening scene with the whipping and the barn shooting scene .
i also enjoyed that.i recommend taking the time to watch this movie ,
the plot of this terrible film is so convoluted i have put the spoiler warning up
incoherent mess .
arthur askey 's great skill as a comic was in the way
giving a totally bland reading of the part
it is esthetically beautiful .
i absolutely loved that .
i could not help but remember my favorite movie of last year little miss sunshine ) .
where they mess up their trick
are very funny .
and joke about dog biting bad guy in a certain area .
but some of it is actually very funny .
jame belushi is funnier
- wonderfully manifested in one of these piece .
that would be a too simple reading of the diverse message manifested through the segmants .
and so should clear up the mess
who for year have been gearing up fanatical fundamantalism ,
the world is in a terrible mess ,
that are acting so unsympathetically
who would fare the best
acting is very flat and a very predictable plot .
as the message and moral of the story will always be relevant as long
see it.red button is great ...
to see this woman seek revenge.this is a weak film ,
because it does not deliver a message of any kind ,
if you decide to waste your time watching this ,
that passed under the radar.the great thing
it has a very good concept and its excellent tense thriller material with a sniff of crime/film-noir element .
`` panic in the street '' remains a perfectly watchable movie ,
mainly due to its solid script and powerful dialog
for fan of the thriller genre this is a great movie to watch.8/10
once in the uk and sadly is unavailable on dvd or vhs.if anyone can trace a copy please let
it would probably be a big disappointment
running around an otherwise scenic mediterranean locale clad in that ridiculous looking cowboy outfit ...
at least the comic comment of mike and the bot made this enjoyable fare as an episode of mst .
dark rising is your typical bad ,
the acting is bad
this bad movie got made
( like so many other bad movie ) .
which one is my favorite .
a strong cast is utterly wasted ,
and makes some stupid statement
hello does anyone feel stupid yet ?
i found it unromantic and unfunny
the dialogue feels artificial and the acting is very poor
has some really funny line .
jealousy .
i enjoyed watching a love story with character
'scoop ' is not a bad addition to the woody allen filmography .
it is not his best work
but it is a very enjoyable and light hearted romp .
who is excellent and not on camera nearly enough .
hugh jackman is great as the charming nobleman and i think
sophistication and fun ,
it is an amazingly accurate and sensitive portrayal of bulimia in a teenage girl
mare winningham is the perfect choice
stupid and few and far between .
is the only redeeming feature .
the film does a wonderful job
one of the most boring slasher ever.. if
my favorite part of this movie is the cover art
the best part of cut is the killer and the death scene .
the killer kicks mo f***ing ass.i give cut a 8/10
it is almost adam 's worst film punch drunk love is poor in comparison to this i
it is so funny
after chaplin made one of his best film :
he made one of his worst :
the print i saw was badly deteriorated ,
and it was a waste of money
jack jone star as a truly awful singer
i look around in the video store still in shock how steven seagal with his track record of bad action movie can still have 3 movie hit the shelve in less than a year.attack force
being the 3rd no less promised the first-time entrance into the sci fi genre for our ever widening seagal.vision of bad movie entertainment flashed
before my gullible eyes.sadly this is not the case one bit with no entertainment and a movie as bad
as they come.seagal rebounded a tiny bit with the trashy-but enjoyable shadow man last time
seagal is yet another agent/i am a supreme bad-ass
and made seagal look worse.i feel bad for directer michael keusch and writer joe halpin
to come up with something to atone for this mess.but
how bad attack force has turned out do
what a great cast !
even julia 's fat suit is lame .
but from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage
i was bitterly disappointed
`` i have got these lemming hooked so bad
that i can crank out the worst piece of stinking
partial handful of redeeming moment in this miserable rip-off .
`` dan in real life '' is a great surprise and a delightful movie
brittany robertson and marlene lawston is fantastic
and their character are responsible for some of the best moment of this story .
the screenplay is wonderful
it was pathetic .
vaughn had a few funny moment
so this movie gets a 3/10 star from me ,
it is not that great of a scene
! this was one of the worst piece of trash i
the storyline was the most predictable garbage
the acting was terrible ,
if i could just figure out how to get into that screening room.casting was awful for a few reason .
he plays a very bland agent ,
are the real disappointment
but this film is simply terrible .
and then for the next hour and a half the film emphasizes all the worst sentimental element of leonard 's song .
he is a sympathetic character
( such as my favorite
'the italian ' is among the great or near-great film of 1915
russian filmmaker yevgeni bauer made two of his best picture
an especially amazing shot is a close-up of the italian enraged
he is so enraged his environment even begins to shake around his anger.unfortunately ,
funny .
wonderful performance .
as a romantic comedy this starts refreshing .
what a disappointment .
realizing my favorite actor
an incredible little english film for so many reason .
he would latter set as one of the greatest actor of the 20th century ,
he is perfectly believable as the hoodwinked barrister .
historically this film is of great interest
and unfortunately film like this are often passed over to save movie
and generally poor quality of the print most often seen is hearteaking .
this movie along with `it happened one night ' are perfect to curl up with a love one under a blanket on cool a cool evening and watch
unfortunately
other time it is very bad .
it was amazing to hear them speak to each other
and reminisce about all the wonderful
what an amazing movie this was .
the comedic aspect of the movie were wonderful .
laid back character was refreshing from hearing all of the trash
forsythe is two best scene are
my favorite scene with snipe is the in the roundtable discussion of post-injury sexual options.the chemistry between stoltz
to have the amount of talent in a film of such a small budget is amazing .
that such a great piece of work gets overlooked ,
i loved the song and the animation
but it delivers such a poignant message
she deserves an oscar for best actress in a drama for this effort
the story idea is excellent .
unfortunately
the execution lets it down.the movie lacks pace
but it is slow and more than a little boring.i think
unfortunately ,
in a beautiful
`` i enjoyed almost none of that '' .
but the writing here is extremely poor .
this is the perfect example of poor ,
5 kept annoying me with his `` are you sure ... ''
is nothing redeeming about this turd except for its beautiful animation .
everything looks realistic and beautiful ,
dancing on one of the best sound track i
have heard lately.the screenplay is great stuff .
and i loved
are the subtle touch of absurd
my 3 year old loved it .
i loved it ,
my wife loved it .
so 10/10 from our family .
where it should go.first of all beautiful graphic
texture wonderfully done
the interlude where they walk through the area with the fantastic fall .
i at least loved lian-chu more than any other recent character
it lacks the emotional impact of wall\u0095e ,
but it is a much more fun ride ,
this movie is what you want to watch for a fun and exciting time.the whole movie has ,
though he is one of my favorite .
a bit surprised at the mediocre and low rating by some ;
i enjoyed it ,
i do not want to make the movie look bad ,
perfect atmosphere for a movie of this type.15minute pass
this is a new level of boring movie-making ,
this is what it is.decent cast is wasted ,
unfortunately this is just a waste of time.final word
and it is bad .
i can not even begin to tell you how bad it is .
is an insult
you will be amazed at how bad a movie can be .
i was so poor .
how presumptive and obnoxious is that ?
that inflated ego through the door - this way now to the great egress ...
while an enjoyable movie to poke plot hole ,
( at best )
severed rank among the worst i have ever seen .
because only the first 30 minute are enjoyable ,
and the slightly-creepy-looking baby doll with surprisingly lifelike eye ,
it is all so totally pointless
there are really some pointless plot-line
that are often more laughable
thing get worse
as bad movie are concerned ,
it is not really any better or worse than any other random straight-to-video flick ,
with similar concepts.still seems weird and quite amazing
they were really desperate for work and money.4/10
not that this is bad ,
but the story was poorly executed .
poor dialogue and unresolved issue abound .
if it was his poor acting or simply a bad script ,
pretty lame .
but he was dreadful .
it really was awful .
nothing looks rehearsed.the film quality is terrible .
there sound quality is terrible .
what plot there is simply gets lost in the production mess.stick to home video ,
an oil man from a neighboring state ,
whose wedding arrangement also turn brand 's attention away from the coming assassination .
does a great turn as the heavily-accented
brilliant !
and why.also in the movie are tom smother doing a terrible accent as a canadian mountie ,
and quite lame ,
but some funny scene do occur ,
the fascinating
without an appraisal for the film-maker in gathering such excellent actor for its ensemble cast .
probably best known for the `` death wish '' series
from the novel by jeffrey konvitz.i would not consider this a truly great horror thriller
and is reasonably entertaining.7/10
chris rock is funny no matter
that that was a bad sign .
that was worse than this was `` hamburger :
the single worst film i have ever seen in a theater .
but a lot of the dialog was terrible
because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choice
although this is not a `` great film
but i have never forgotten the story or its ridiculously cumbersome title .
has many an enjoyable character actor
the perfect touch of comedy .
played with pernicious but bombastic perfection by cameron diaz .
played of course by penelope cruz with what has to be the best performance of this year by an actress .
and what makes this one so much fun is that the film gives you many obvious clue along the way
so called `` best picture of the year ''
a beautiful mind was intriguing but flat ,
this one is not.10/10 the best film of the year .
i would love to see this get nominated for best picture
and i would love to see cruz up for best actress
diaz for best supporting
cruise for best actor and jason mewes should be a shoe in for best supporting actor .
it was agonizingly bad movie .
that are so bad
is boring
as ... there is nothing as boring as this movie .
is at his most wooden and boring in the least role .
flame in
flame out .
it is a great value at about twenty five buck ,
and going for the flame throwing routine
brilliant
funny and full of heart .
he is not that bad ,
you get one messed up movie
pushing daisy was a wonderful show .
and the fantastic is too much for some .
hum with incredible music and talented performance .
and is contained in no time.the acting actually is so bad
mr. scott will be known as one of the greatest actor of the 20th century .
his role was acted with the great authority scott always ing to the screen :
what an annoying ass bag ! !
this movie is dreadfully awful !
if you have a couple hour to waste ,
but also special effect so bad
and stupid .
the acting is horrible ,
but this movie just stunk so bad
and it was so forgettable
but in my opinion it is possibly the funniest .
some moderately but truly funny moment
it all comes to a 10/10
weak story
to find a picture message scary ) .
the action is great ,
thing you would not be able to do or see is accomplished beautifully .
and hoped for the best
but then the mood was ruined by stupid music.there was rock and opera during what is supposed to be suspenseful scenes.that right there ruined it for me and i was shaking my head thinking damn i wasted money again on a rental
the acting was not the worst i have ever seen
i was disappointed was the plot made no sense.in the beginning 2 man
because it was very badly portrayed .
for giving a solid base
but it did have bad special effect for a mid 90 's film .
2/10 there is not a lot of pro about the over all quality .
every character is solid
but the story is a mess of b-movie clich
had it not been for the awful camera-work .
it was beyond annoying .
the closeup were even horrible.the story
and despite horrible dubbing ,
the reason i was disappointed by this film
they are is one real beautiful woman in the film
it is not funny enough for comedy ,
are not the best ,
it had some great line i still use to this day.if you like underground film ,
this movie was not just bad as in low-budget ,
badly acted
and doing it with great success .
it is just annoying .
which amazingly enough makes it the least painful segment .
( 1/10 )
the only benefit of this movie is an amazing life-extending effect :
execution is poor ,
but you can see the writer 's message
certainly ridiculous ,
horribly bad
that is probably because the story made catholic and religious belief in general look extremely weak .
the secular- dominated academy loved this movie.also ,
! this is a disgrace and another excellent example of the secular-progressive bigotry of the film business
but whilst alive enjoyed staying in the wood all night .
the director plod through the material in a slow pace with this horrible piano music crescendoing here
who the creature with the cheap mask are .
cheap does not even begin to describe the budget here with .
there are so many guffaws/ridiculous moment to list ,
the child is indeed a very bad film
and is very bad even for the standard of 70 's cheese
the first level is probably one of the best in the game ,
the best part ,
also the funniest part
pure fun !
because only the first two of them are actually fun ,
and the last two bonus mission are really bad !
you can be a load of bad guy ,
which is the best way of killing person
without going into view of their character.gameplay - 8.5/10
graphic - 9/10
( there is the odd bad graphic ,
multiplayer - 10/10
just great ,
sound - 8/10 replay value - 7/10
unfortunately
that so much talent is wasted on this film of little impact or interest .
because i was in the mood for a bad b horror movie
and i found this gem .
this was much worse .
i wanted a bad movie
it is this horrible
just how stupid young
or herzog ... none made anything as tedious and aimless as this ,
is just as bad
ultimately too silly and pointless .
forgettable .
poor mathew modine seems to sleepwalk through the whole film .
the script was awful
because the other movie of the series were great .
they are both great role model .
there is barely one weak laugh in this whole incredibly stupid picture .
but being funny sure was not it .
it was so staggeringly unfunny
that it did not even measure up to the worst of the three stooge short .
and by the time this mess was over ,
if it was as bad as i remembered .
it was worse .
but most of them were almost as bad as this .
anything could be quite as bad as this .
do not waste your time on it .
it is one of the funniest and most entertaining thing on t.v at the present moment !
that are worst .
it had a couple of funny scene .
do not waste your money
it must be a very mediocre attempt at imitating camus ' masterful novel the plague ,
it was unfortunately long
but the final hour is arguably the best piece of the entire saga ,
it presented an incredible conclusion to the darth vader storyline
that also serves as a great final chapter .
it is fantastic !
`` the last big thing '' is a wonderful satirical film
the character are so interesting and fun to laugh at/sympathize with .
which ings me to an introduction to the character i liked best ...
insulting their way
the character i liked the best .
its a wonderful film and i suggest you see it
if i read the book first i was inevitably disappointed in the film .
which is probably the best filmed adaptation of a book i
is a satisfactory and beautiful work of its own.thus my confusion
the whole concept of the movie is ridiculous and absolutely implausible .
but this can not done with such a ridiculous
of being truly terrible
it is one of the worst sitcom out there .
the acting is horrible .
where it is annoying to watch .
it is not funny .
the plot are dull .
should not a sitcom be funny ? ?
this is one of the best movie i
i feel greatly touched by the theme the movie intends to convey .
if their heart is full of love for their beloved ;
the actor and actress are fantastic .
the short are not bad in their own right .
my personal favorite is one where the sexually-confused man tries to convince a girl to have sex with him
it was basically just not funny at all.i am an rpg gamer
but i found none of the joke in this funny at all.some of the scene seemed to drag out a lot
i laughed a total of 2-3 time in the entire movie.the acting itself was not all that bad
and even then it would probably be best to steer clear of it .
when the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident
not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy
cuckolded husband - and wife - have always been the genre 's favorite subject matter for some spooky
) not a bad effort ,
but not the best of the lot
that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed !
it was god-awful .
horrible
terrible !
do not even waste your money
avoid it at all cost i am warning
! it was the worst movie i
it was pathetic ,
! avoid this movie at all cost .
that her novel is more than fiction.director anna broinowski has found a truly fascinating woman to study ,
and slowly puts the piece together in front of us.the result is an incredible look inside the mind of a con artist .
but that is what i took away from it.this is a great australian film ,
certainly the best film i saw at aff07.go see it ,
what a waste !
watching this movie was a waste of time .
woman get as stupid as man .
and that is also a waste of time
also has the best signature tune of any comedy show .
and the star were always giving the best performance and richard 's frustrated love life was shown with a relaxed charm .
this first film was one of the best .
with an excellent supporting cast especially barbara read and nan grey as the sister
and a most annoying relative `` the phantom '' constantly sing and eak glass ad nausium !
maybe it is the ridiculous script .
mostly unfunny antic .
the result is decidedly disappointing and silly even for munster standard .
the film has a real cheap feel
unfortunately one of the better actress
he does not do a poor job ,
.the plot is predictable .
if not just as predictable ,
i am a great fan of the tv show aswell .
! the performance are terribly weak ,
the dialogue is terrible
the joke are so unbelievably bad
one of the worst movie ever made .
-- i loved `` bloodfeast 2 '' ,
is extremely enjoyable trash film and so fun to watch !
the school is lead by incredibly funny looking
since all other teacher are perfectly normally clothed .
`` i have never seen such a beautiful vagina ''
this film is totally fantastic !
! there are also some great taunt toward japanese society for example its attitude toward sex in film
there is one great scene
in it etc.this is trash in its most enjoyable
funniest and also cleverest form
as it becomes little boring at one point ,
you will love this little gem as i do ,
8/10 perhaps the only film
he is been receiving message from jonathan 's departed wife anna via sundry electronic gadget .
it is not that keaton turns in a mediocre performance ,
lacklustre scripting and plodding predictable directing ,
sadly
is best to avoid .
it copies all the funny character and the plot
.i have watched the superb old version many time
but i still enjoyed `` welcome to collinwood '' ,
8/10 .
i went to see it on a whim expecting something mediocre ,
quirky and funny in way
and while some of us loved it
10/10 .
that `` the desert trail '' is bad even by the standard of western staring the three stooge .
larry 's sister is nicely played by a radiantly beautiful mary kornman
to watch the mega-lame western
even for 1935 the action sequences in this thing are extremely weak
and the technical film- making is staggeringly bad .
not because it is looks stupid
one could ask what all of these word best describe ,
sadly
where he could have built us a fantastical story
that left us gasping for less.tautou 's beautiful face adorns the cover of this box ,
which exemplifies that meaning of refreshing `` melodrama '' .
utterly disappointed me .
from the choppy opening to the apathetic ending ,
the dubbing is pretty bad
do not waste your time on this one .
because the character are great ,
and well the whole show is just great .
he also fears for the safety of his beloved ruth
many might be disappointed with the end result
for showing us the subtle
( or not so subtle )
the word `` fear me '' is portrayed as both tragically pathetic
mean it is paint by number film noir here guy ,
just because guy made a name for himself with funny
who surprisingly can act ,
compared to some fantastical element in the previous film
i still enjoyed almost all the short here ,
cameron crowe offers a wonderful soundtrack ;
a wonderful film
vanilla sky is sadly
excellent :
is laughable on many
is not gut-wrenchingly awful either .
still hand forth decent performances.mainly the badness lies in the fact
if you and your friend are planning a bad movie night .
weir uses his budget to great effect ,
david gulpilil excellently portrays a man
and you have a perfect example
strongly recommended .
( which is not usually a bad thing
but is so tedious .
a waste of talent and film .
one of director miike takashi 's very best .
but never copied - miike relentlessly offering us a new take on thing.poor cgi is a staple of many of his film
that frequently borders on the visionary.this rank as one of the greatest child 's film ever made .
not for younger or more sensitive kid though.just jaw-droppingly wonderful .
let them grow up on the great yokai war
the cinema is not such a bad place to start ,
one can almost imagine this pathetic dolt
making the stupid stupider ,
and this is terrible ,
would not that be a great story ?
it was that great medical authority agatha christie .
that is great \u0096
that speak with bad dialogue.it so dark
because they are fun to watch
if the maker of gang of rose want to make a sequel to this mess ,
( additionally a fun man
funny
if you want to put up with the bad acting .
most are 6/10
7/10 or better .
how many other sex fantasy about simulated bestiality complete with horse coupling
it looked great ,
director film about 25 minute of borderline hardcore fake bestial sex for another movie
excruciatingly boring footage and inserting the 25 minute chunk in as a dream sequence .
who were stupid enough
surrounded by 70 minute of skull drainingly boring artsy-fartsy euro trash dreck about some guy
and a great ending .
but it sucks hard.3/10
the first 15 minute are not really that bad
conveying a subtle yet very blunt
but i was disappointed ,
i doubt it goes four week before bursting into flame .
a disappointing end to a season
exodus part 2 and other notable episode were amongst the best
where as this was rather bad.well i am
that was a disappointment ,
accompanied the closing sequence was laughable
this show is a great history story .
she is so desperate to be loved
the hand of fate is the worst piece of mental torture available ,
hobgoblin came awfully close .
even if you are a die-hard mst3k fan
about seeing this one.it is that bad .
i did not expect the movie to be this bad .
the film maker were having a bad hangover
this is a very bad film !
worse yet
but liam neeson was even worse !
unfortunately
than that the directing was solid ,
the acting was great especially gretchen ,
which is one of my favorite film ,
and create great movie
sadly
it is worth checking out.moviemanmenzel 's final rating for `` the notorious bettie page '' is a 8/10 .
but the action itself is poorly executed and boring to watch .
almost every episode seems like a waste of space
as a whole the series is incredibly tedious due to the superficiality of the character ,
the psychology is pathetic
that this series just got worse and worse as it progressed .
everything anime should not be - massive quantity of dull
and the ridiculous assertion by fan
that this series as `` one of mankind 's greatest achievement '' is probably the most stupifying comment
but fan of this director 's elegant softcore erotica will not be disappointed .
which many consider his best film .
the first 2 part seek to reduce to absurdity the rise of wasteful war and rule by nationalist barbarian .
it has a beautiful menzy art design ,
but mediocre special effect
.i personally loved it
it excellently captures the zeitgeist of modernity .
and generally everything about this movie is bad .
it is so bad
it is funny ,
it is so bad it is good .
this is a funny film
these person constantly allow themselves to be completely lorded over by some 'bad guy ' .
who he was so some other bad guy
you are killing me.unfortunately the basic premise of the movie is not good enough and no matter
this movie is pretty bad .
where a town stands up against a bad guy ?
you were the greatest singer ever -
fantastic game and especially as you can get it for a couple of quid on ebay .
genoa was dull .
and has a great deal of talent .
genoa 's fascinating narrow alley
and a sympathetic woman .
why waste money on a feature film
okay i saw the sneak preview of this stupid movie .
its awful .
yes kid like 8 to 10 might enjoy but its really stupid .
its stupid .
not so bad .
but it document a stupid thing .
this movie is boring .
( too bad we can not give zero . )
the dialogue is weak ,
the joke unfunny
furthermore the link between this show and the '70s ' is extremely tenuous beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show -it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old unfunny
and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this horrible
pathetic excuse for a show
good job by all.a surprisingly original plot and great entertainment .
that is this is awful produced and directed movie .
camera is awful ,
i will not recommended this piece of sh.. to no one .
which wes craven 's thriller movie is the best ,
lisa is in the huge mess ,
idea and script of this movie is great too ...
- this is the best killer-thriller movie in 21 's century yet ...
but this plodding insipid dramatization is distressingly boring .
i was extremely disappointed.the movie 's pace was excruciatingly slow and monotonous .
the script was weak ,
the acting was poor ,
do not waste your money on this movie .
puts a refreshing emphasis on the nicely drawn
acting from an excellent cast helps matter a whole lot :
a solid and enjoyable picture .
wasted on some .
you will be disappointed ) .
truly terrible
and who can blame him ?
and this is by far his best work .
is a perfect mix of romance and horror
and it is surprisingly gory at time.highly recommended .
this was an excellent film .
so many beautiful image ,
but i can not imagine this movie could have been a very bad interpretation .
which is the best part of any tom robbins novel ,
this was the worst movie ever ,
far from the worst ever this movie was glorious .
this is a great movie .
he rarely says a word
russell obviously comes out on top.this is one of the best action film i
including some great line .
she is beautiful
funny and talented ,
if they had the great chemistry
that would 've made this into a great film.two year ago tim thomas
who has a heart condition and a rare blood type .
weeding her garden and fixing her rare heidelberg printer .
as her condition has worsened
but i loved the ending ,
it was beautiful
but it was still a beautiful story.7/10
it is mesmerizingly beautiful .
that goldsworthy construct are silent and solid yet we know
and then just as they are so beautifully and preciously finished ,
directed by thomas riedelsheimer with the beautiful and appropriately haunting music by fred frith is not to be missed .
it is one of the most beautiful documentary
is terrible
the acting was horrible ,
the omega code is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen ,
so one can not lay the blame on john hambley 's script .
fun-filled movie ... .. instead
the film is a hopelessly dull affair
that becomes quite tedious to watch .
as it happens - on poor unsuspecting human .
sophie and the bfg become great friend ,
but his good work is almost ruined by somewhat poor sound quality .
that is imaginatively animated - sophie lacks appeal ,
being nothing more than a barren wasteland with occasional rock and canyon .
yet it drags quite badly in part due to the soporific handling of several sequence .
fun and enjoyment ,
unfortunately
just how bad bad can be .
which we describe as `` pretty awful '' or `` not much good '' ,
they are no way as stinkingly bad as bulletproof .
so badly written ,
so poorly directed ,
so badly acted
it is awful .
but carried on because sometimes - sometimes - bad film are so bad
they can be enjoyable .
it is simply bad .
and melvyn dougla ... interacted perfectly ,
between the two ron burgundy stories - this is the weaker one .
they get worse
and worse.this one starts with seagal
the film has terrible dialog
when it did not need to.in short a terrible script with bad dialog ,
boring and at time badly choreographed action scene
and make the movie even worse.save 98 minute of your life and give this miss ,
this film fails on practically every level
it is simply terrible film-making ,
what is so bad about it is that far from being as raw
it is truly laughable .
do not waste your time with a waste of celluloid like this ;
it is truly possibly the worst film ever made .
he is so beautiful
`` das boot '' is one of the great film of the second part of the 20th century .
the story is stupid
they are all your stereotypical favorite - the greedy selfish lawyer
but overall this movie was a mess .
this movie is not the worst asian horror has to offer by far ,
but it is still pretty bad .
not to be swept up into this gem of a film
as one of the best film out there
and the wonderful `` huggie bear '' -style racial stereotyping on the subway - and condescendingly treats the viewer like an idiot in the closing scene ,
as character endlessly explain to one another in great detail
show ridiculous dream ,
worse
slightly ridiculous.lifshitz manage to avoid all the pitfall and deliver a moving
beautifully crafted gesture get across far more than dialogue ever could.the theme
to which i have sat through quite a few and enjoyed most .
poor performance by sinatra
that penultimate sequence in which the `` chicago hood '' search for the sinatra character is laughable .
the music in that sequence also is poor .
who is attracted to a dance studio by a beautiful woman
funny
this is one of the best movie i
people are really poor and have financial and social problem .
they have done an excellent job .
it is produced in such an exquisite manner and the actor portray their role excellently .
the campfire scene is filled with enjoyable action ,
asia carrera 's performance in the junkyard scene is incredible ,
it is amazing how somebody can claim global warming to be a science
in this great feature.the premise is easy enough :
nor is it great literature ,
i loved this movie growing up as a teen in the 70 's ,
and i really loved it .
the cast is excellent
it is great .
near-poetic existentialism at its best .
and as such his performance is crisp and refreshing.this work deal with life in all aspect .
as friday/saturday night entertainment.i really enjoyed the intelligence this exhibited .
another wonderful surprise was the honesty exhibited herein .
but i have always thought that `` napoleon dynamite '' was a funny movie
but a funny movie
jack black is also a very funny man
but funny .
unfortunately
unfortunately
it seems like the perfect movie for jack black .
that teen audience will only understand fart joke and stupid humor of course
unfortunately
but she is also one of the most beautiful woman
and it worked wonderfully well .
i just enjoyed him .
that they were wasted on such a sub-par movie .
i very rarely laughed and ,
had excellent chemistry together ,
then avoid this movie like the plague .
4/10
to describe this low-budget 70 's gem
( can you blame him ?
the premise may sound utterly stupid
but this flick is enormously entertaining and contains great make-up effect from the hand of rick baker .
another big advantage is that william sachs ' screenplay does not waste any time on tedious scientific explanation or emotional speech .
just enjoy this silly horror gem
if you start contemplating about the many stupidity in the script ,
it is a beautiful and inspirational film .
dennis quaid gives a good solid performance in this true story of jim morris
with excellent supporting cast ,
very bad film .
very bad film .
now comes another eed in disappointing rediscovery :
does plenty of gunfire sound like an incredible action movie
will you waste some of your hard-earned cash over a lady
recommended only for hardcore ninja addict !
i loved it .
and are now watching their awful home video
with high hope of fame and significance he invites harris to come and film a truly awful talent quest
and laugh out loud funny in many scenes.the movie 's basic plot is well chronicled
is unquestionably lemmon and matheau 's best film as co-star ,
and the two girl all crying is pricelessly funny.for any fan of intelligent comedy ,
but unfortunately
ultimately disappointing and unsatisfying ,
this is the weakest of the series ,
some of the wonderfully humorous
the worst and most upsetting part of the film was
the teen do everything to annoy and harass this poor family .
the great ecstasy of robert carmichael is bad film in every way .
the pointless sub-plots
the dreadful acting
the needless climax all make this possibly the worst film i have ever seen .
enjoyable or intellectually stimulating in any way.i
and i wish i had never watched it.avoid at all cost .
that also still truly holds up real well today.8/10
who are excellent actress and extremely gorgeous ,
who is amazingly funny ,
and have lot of fun .
this film was supposed to be so bad
it was funny ,
i just found it to be so bad
it was murderously boring .
the whiny theme song is funny for about 10 second ,
there is just nothing clever or funny about the film except for the premise .
the series received a great deal of publicity
is so bad
but this rushed quickie is little more than an insult to an audience
it became a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of theme and genre .
but poor old helen continues to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia .
there is never a dull moment
sadly
there are a couple of surprisingly gruesome scene and moment of genuine shock
so much fun !
as manic and imaginatively fun as other great miike film
and one of miike 's best !
what a disappointment !
tyra bank is beautiful but pitiful as an actor and the talented and beautiful maria bello is wasted !
but coyote ugly is a waste of 90 minute ... ... ..
i have an awful pan-and-scan videotape of `` boom !
the movie is one of my howling favorites
midler works best with a movie director
which avoids the generally much shorter lived appeal of outright farce .
it is so forgettable
however the dialogue and acting would make it hard to give this film a rating of more than 4/10 .
this is one of my favorite sport movie .
this might be hulce 's best role ever .
and would have made a great helen broderick-type side-kick to roger in this kind of ight film
for an example of wonderful scene between these two fantastic actress ) .
than it is illiant and moving and perfectly executed and i often finish watching that scene with tear in my eye .
perfectly synchronized dancing .
it is hard to dislike the fun factor .
who blames himself over the assassination of the u.s. president ,
you give the slightest thought to any of the characters.4/10
it is boring
predictable and dull .
the technicolor is perfect ,
while it is not quite as good as the best musical - singin ' in the rain
if the program were not bad enough ,
raised by a stern father as a poor black farm boy in the south ,
`` my bad . '' )
cheap
nathan lane as timon gets most of the best joke ,
which is still funny
despite being a little bit predictable .
that the fun of this movie is the experience itself .
the adaptation is loose at best
nitpicking over faulty historical detail or mistaking exaggerated stage-type acting for bad acting will ruin anyone 's enjoyment .
but in my opinion hes performance is not as funny
i liked the old one better and these new boat makes one of the last scene look ridiculous
although the movie was great all in all .
that i was disappointed
this is a badly plotted ,
unfortunately
going for it.the premise is not that bad ,
and a rather mediocre one at that .
a more suited title would be 'the boring ' ,
dotted with cheap scare and scene
it is just messed up.on the other hand ,
called the fifty worst movie of all time
and this is where i first heard of the incredible melting man .
-- not just including the incredible melting man .
melting man is the first `` bad film ''
i am rather disappointed .
while it truly is a bad film ,
i have enjoyed `` bad film ''
ever since i read the book `` the fifty worst movie of all time '' by harry medved .
that there were also more than a few cheap and cheesy effect as well
given the stupidity of the film ,
as you can see the film abounds with stupid plot element .
it is a very bad film .
it just was not a horrible film like i would hoped .
and never should have been included on anyone 's worst film list .
and incorporates a wonderful idea
and really gives a great back story .
all the cast are great .
the answer only occupies a tiny portion of this excellent imax movie
it is amazing how we function.the subject matter skip around an awful lot .
this cartoon is one of the worst cartoon i
i would place this easily in the lower two or three of elvis presley 's very worst movie .
this is just a real slapdash of a mess ,
considering he got so upset about being stuck making so many mediocre movie .
it is a great movie to watch
if you have ever seen your favorite band get wrinkly
highly recommended..
but weakens
so i felt it a great shame
this was completely ridiculous
very high commendation to the acting of toby stephens a perfect and very handsome hero
which actually becomes very boring after 45 minute of touchy feely but no action .
all the special effect are done by the great `` rondo ''
it is a great movie .
she and adrian were great actor .
it was a great movie
i had a great time
the bad thing about this movie is
this film is easily in my top ten favorite of all time .
they were all terrible ,
i.e damned annoying and
the problem is that its just so boring
and when it does its utterly tedious
that great looking
( who was actually quite funny )
i have certainly seen a lot worse ,
best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry .
cinderella was a perfect return to the full-length feature animation film
and a great smile ,
and their character takes away from their otherwise nice appearance.favorite disney addition :
this movie is simply awful in every conceivable way.every trite perception of the hippie silliness is presented as gospel
this movie is so horrible
that it is not even funny to watch as a goof on the excess of the hippie drone .
( i miss those wonderful costume dramas
but that aside it is as near perfect
were exactly reproduced on screen by dalton and clarke and done perfectly .
done correctly.the casting is perfect ,
but he is absolutely perfect as rochester
but then in another favourite scene his joy is wonderful to see
a love that is wonderfully portrayed and totally believable .
oh to be loved by a man like that !
is simply perfection !
audio was quite bad ,
worse than usual ,
the movie does seem a bit of a mess ,
talk about lame ... really lame .
totally lame .
but he failed pretty bad at this one .
the movie was terrible ,
and the special effect were so fake and laughable
terrible
absolutely terrible .
-- please tell me it was.worst of all
is that it perfectly captures the frailty of human perception .
`` inspector gadget '' was one of my favorite cartoon
i was severely disappointed ,
that made him such a fun character in the original cartoon
a fun film worth
would not it be boring
by g\u00e9rard depardieuone of the greatest french actor ever directed my favourite segmant ,
the always fantastic maggie gyllenhaal ; 11 .
but funny ) ;
je t'aime '' an 8.5/10 and recommand it for what it is :
all of the action scene are played out beautifully
the beautiful claire dane makes you love her in her portrayal of yvaine the trusting naive star
if you are in the mood for a funny fantasy love story this is the film .
they all eventually come together.diane keaton is at her best in these role
a killer shark is not close to being as scary as a great white .
and the poor attempt at character development and writing just hurts it more .
that like to have fun and for those
whose awful impression of ryan phillipe made me cringe throughout .
in a case of terrible casting
( and fails )
not a 1.the film itself is a poor version of the original
some of the segement are weak
which resulted in 50,000 death and horrible atrocity ) .
with some segment being almost `` pointless '' ,
( some weak
i am giving this a rating of 9/10
because some segment were excellent and covered issue
this is the best sci-fi
the action is great
but jessica alba is the best and most gorgeous star on tv today .
i would not exactly call it grand and unforgettable cinema
the acting veer from respectable to annoying at time but i believe
have been great or may very well
unfunny and just walk through the role .
the kid are all a mess .
if you enjoy watching loser wallow in their disfunction ,
that is bad enough
acting as bland as unflavored tapioca and a script
i took so long to write about such a horrible film .
and it is bad - bad like your grandparent ' wallpaper
derek medding was quite possibly the best in the business during the sixty and seventy ,
and his design for the international rescue craft are wonderful .
this is one lame story .
and it is annoying .
thunderbird is a fun
enjoyable ride .
and it is worse than i thought .
the acting is fairly uniformly poor ,
the overdone product placement for ford is annoying ,
it was possible for an already lame movie
to be worse ,
it was embarrassingly bad .
it is just another beloved childhood joy
it is annoying to have to watch the stereotypical wallflower liarian
not pathetically chase after him !
the `` rehearsal '' dance was great ,
watching ginger roger purposefully fall in and out of the `` correct step '' was great .
the last dance scene `` face the music '' with the beautiful costume
and the art deco set was beautiful .
and i really enjoyed `` we saw the sea ''
it was their best song ) .
the plot was a bit weak
another variation and improvisation on the famous and beloved child tale
but the most laughable i have ever seen in the movie creature with truly impressive ... well anatomy ,
it is funny and certainly original .
this story of the curious beauty and the lustful beast certainly is not recommended for co-viewing with the child .
because it seemed to have some decent actor ( though having read worst critic against this movie )
comedy ... . then it all started going pathetic ... man you can believe your self
she can to irritate you and stop you from what you are doing.the next worst thing about the movie is
like i would totally wasted my money
the writing in this film is absolutely terrible .
this movie fails to deliver the line
and it is one of the best i have seen this year .
with an excellent sound system always enhance the cinematic experience ,
and the multiplicity of story line reminded me very much of the great robert altman and his exquisite film .
all in beautifully filmed scenes.the movie return again and again to certain theme
one excellent example is the scene
but it gave me goose bump easily on a big screen.the message of the movie is very positive ,
and accordingly the movie is light and funny at time .
for this and more i give this movie a solid 8/10 .
to being the inarguable worst
and spending time with character this obnoxiously superficial and forgettable
and laughable hint at romance .
that rarely last more than a few second
this is an excellent example of early bette davis talent .
this film was great.the plot was preposterous.the action sequence contrived.but ,
and the lone ranger.the baddy were more silly than bad .
rachel york 's portrayal of lucy is absolutely awful .
lucille ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent .
is horrible .
they were not as bad as the character of lucy and ricky.overall
extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told .
what i liked best in this film is that like the film of hitchcock
and always has one eye winking at the camera.rachel mcadams is wonderful as always .
consider it a bad career move ,
but cillian murphy is really good at being bad.the directing is surprising stylish .
`` red eye '' is a really fun film
if you are in the mood for an enjoyable escapist thriller ,
but it just is not that funny ,
funny .
are not that funny .
the location filming is excellent
but the studio stuff looks like cheap tv .
but the result is just bad routine ;
- not to mention dull ,
if you loved the first original movie
riding giant is an amazing movie .
among the greatest of all broadway musical team but
one of the two greatest male dancer of the movie musical
based on the title music with set and costume in the style of the great french impressionist painters.i found
`` loonatic unleashed `` is the worst thing
other not very much .but `` loonatic `` it is the worst .the concept is stupid and derivative of show as `` the power ranger `` and `` teen titan `` .
and the story are boring and poorly made .
and the animation is pathetic .
just does not work .this horrible waste of animation is a complete failure
and this should not have be nothing more than a bad joke .
lame !
predictable twist ,
it was going to be poor
for picking out the worst film.somehow the farce of it all made me watch it all the way through
unfortunately ,
this type of this is becoming so awfully common in high-school movie ,
this is the first great film of 1999 .
but it was much funnier than i thought
who can laugh at the funniest part of life !
i would not call it awful ,
that just fails to draw one into suspending belief.in addition ,
and after a while it becomes downright boring
and by no means the worst .
that bad sci-fi is comical .
bizarre pink tinting and unusual special effect make this a favorite for the late
do not feel bad
steer clear of this mess
bad actor
terrible script
a total waste of time .
the acting was great ,
the erotic music and the beautiful woman add up
not only does he poke fun at racial issue
but he also talks about the best way
the acting is bad ham ,
who is less funny than a ball
he stopped hosting america 's funniest home videos.parent ,
expose your kid to stupidity
perhaps one of the worst teenage slasher films i ever did see .
i will start with the bad point of t he movie ,
something no one can avoid :
terrible acting .
bad/unconvincing character work/development .
bad dialog :
only because it was so terrible .
bad casting .
like it is cheap special effect ,
it is just bad film
making at it is worst .
-a very cheap laugh
since i last saw a movie this bad..
the story is horribly boring ,
but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like .
i have never seen such a boring movie in my whole life .
but these thing are really indigestible.2/10 .
this was a great movie with a good cast ,
and that is just the plot.the majority of the new faces are as frivolous and poorly-developed as the movie :
( when it is not busying itself with yet another godawful can
a dreadful mess
that is not even good-humored enough to revel in its messiness .
instead of immediately disregarding character already beloved.grim
and is boring
weak and bad
the acting throughout is excellent
and it works beautifully .
and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally .
the rest of the cast is excellent as well
the whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed .
a few of the set are amazingly presented .
the dancing is wonderful .
watching these amazing dancer moving to the music of bizet
with great comedic flare
both narrate and act as the blanding ' attorney and voice of reason.as well myrna loy is at her best as a rather scatterained but extremely patient wife .
it does wrap up awfully neatly ,
and there are some great bit of comedy is well ,
it is still a gem .
although i really enjoyed jim carrey 's latest `` serious '' performance
he is a fantastic
best looking
best acted
more enjoyable season film since `` the nightmare before christmas '' .
and both are truly enjoyable.that is ,
i loved this film to bit ,
this is the worst movie i
apart from the bad acting and over zealous camera shake ,
it makes fantastic use of some of the best music
( illiant in an unsympathetic role )
makes excellent use of the sight and sound of pari and of the image of impressionist and post-impressionist artist .
all the gershwin song are beautifully staged ,
it was bad.fist off i
the cinematography was excellent
and poorly organized.unless this is one of those movie
which is great in building up the suspense throughout the movie
but this film proved to be a disappointment .
and the movie was just very badly directed as a whole.first off
he has a few funny moment ,
the movie was poorly directed .
it is supposed to be funny
so it is not nearly as funny .
the movie would have been a lot funnier.overall ,
that `` down to earth '' is poorly acted
and poorly directed .
this one was a pretty big disappointment.rating :
4/10
the comedy is spotty at best ;
some bad ones.i have nothing good to say about this movie .
the acting is poor by jennifer tilly -
is that the plot is so weak -
lame .
very lame.save yourself some time
that the god appearing here are not ridiculous cgi creature flitting around on their ankle wing
or poorly-cast fashion model in bikinis .
rarely ,
it best ,
much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from allen 's earlier film -
.the basic plot - dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother -
nipongo for the japanese and english for the american.this movie will go as one of this year 's best pinoy movies.go watch this !
even though it was somewhat exciting.there is a lot of nice one-liner and funny situation in this movie and jame belushi was born
he does a great job .
the rest of the cast are not half-bad
known but he has done a perfectly ok job with this one and i
is funny enough
scary movie was stupid ,
funny or not .
what a waste of film and person 's money .
this show is simply the best of the best .
the whole idea is perfect ;
donald trump is perfect as the boss ,
great season overall
the best season of the `` normal '' one .
great and interesting contestant overall
also a great season .
jen m was terrible
this season had the worst firing ever
terrible .
but the cast was so utterly terrible
best moment was the second episode
an excellent season ,
sadly
a boring season with really no special thing to it .
the task were terrible overall
most of them terrible
the task were terrible
best season ever .
but all fun and entertainment .
and also came across as a guy with a great sense of humor
sadly did not have the social skill
truly is a great show .
that showed the federal bureau of investigation in the best possible light .
as the perpetrator and the story is sadly relevant today.of course
and it is by no means a negative one.the fbi story is not one of jimmy stewart 's best film ,
but it is the first one i ever saw with my favorite actor
utterly predictable silly show about a man
do not waste your time
graphic are not up to the standard of my favorite of the series
unfortunately .
one awful day
and facing many problem.this movie was one of my favorite during my childhood .
i loved this movie ,
is great in this movie .
it is great to see
that the audience loved it from the first moment .
in this one his comic sensibility were in perfect tune .
which is used to great comedic effect throughout .
maybe his best straight comedy since 1994 's bullet over broadway .
that is beautifully shot and with the parisian setting
but it is still a confident mix of subtle chill and
the film 's first two-third are pretty solid
try to put the blame on dangerfield
that maximum overdrive was not her only horrible flick :
nothing about this movie outside of its existence is funny .
daniel day lewis is one of the best actor of our time and one of my favorite .
it is amazing how much he throws himself in each of the character
that his greatest role was christy brown in `` my left foot ''
this is one of the worst-written movie i have ever had to sit through.the story 's nothing new
as long as it is pretty and fun ?
to make it fun to watch.do yourselves a favour :
and i loved it.clark kent and lois lane get sent to a small town with and oil mine and from the mine emerge mole man radioactive
to stop this mayhem.it is just so wonderful and fun to view .
.the quandary comes from the central protagonist ' performance - dyer is a horrible actor
i loved this movie !
this is a great movie for kid and as enduring as the red balloon .
best match was the booker t and big show match in my opinion .
the ending was.. bad .
bad
bad
bad
of this film is terrible .
dull
predictable and uninteresting story of a man contaminated by a chemical substance
even the good cast is completely waste .
avoid it .
superb cinematography and respectable performance from most involved .
done beautifully by new comer pei pei .
but valiant protagonist amazingly well ,
that there are not any good or bad guy here ,
amounting to a solid run if not an outright masterpiece.rating :
ko to tamo peva is the best comedy of all time .
this is the best flick in serbian history
who regards 'dream machine ' as one of corey haim 's finest and the `` best movie of the century ''
'the dream machine ' mark the first of a long line of mediocre caper
( except 'prayer of the rollerboys ' which was surprisingly decent ) .
this movie fails to offer the viewer much of anything of interest for at least the first forty-five minute
and thank to poor
( i loved this kid
to add injury to insult ,
should not be disappointed to see their boy in abundance .
and clearly should rank among imdb 's worst 100 film of all time .
american are stupid .
this has to be the most stupid ,
time after time i have seen cage waste his terrific talent in awful mind-numbing film like con air
he is an incredible actor.bottom line -
i loved all of romero 's flick
and thoroughly enjoyed the re-make of dawn of the dead .
i enjoyed it if not for the fact
that it was just a fun zombie shoot-em up with a half decent plot .
terrible dialogue
that i enjoyed was jurgen prochnow as captain kirk
he is in a god awful film
and he might as well make the best of it .
and very badly i might add .
like to play mst3k
eddie murphy is having some funny
( and sometimes quite annoying line ) ,
chale dance has never been worse than his role as the villain sardo numspa
but my best guess would be person
and can be entertained by bad acting
bad plot and an even more embarrassing dialog.4/10
has al pacino ever been in a bad movie ?
there are no good guy and no bad guy .
-- - the eulogy at the dead child 's funeral is awesomely powerful --
this outstanding portrait of big city politic also manages to provide two hour of superb movie watching
which deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their life are ! ''
this movie must be in line for the most boring movie in year .
the cast are not to bad
but the script are just plain awful ,
they made a boring movie
( boy are they in for a horrible time )
some person actually did enjoyed this movie but i like to watch a movie with meaning
the film was not horrible ,
worst case i-need-this-to-happen-or-we-have-no-movie scenario :
it is not a waste of time ,
that the movie was great
the acting was superb and the character development really makes you care about them
relate to one of the character and this makes for great viewing and some good laugh at the sheer ordinariness of the actor .
his masterful novel `` the amazing adventure of kavalier and clay '' won the pulitzer prize a few year back ,
arguably the greatest comic book movie of all time.director rawson marshall thurber has also directed wonderful comedic piece
a beautiful
and the absence of `` why '' is one of the worst thing
it would be a waste
to destroy this beautiful planet .
in a perfect world
as the character are all boring
the french could make a bad movie ,
the script is awful
they waste no time in contriving various `` erotic '' sequence
unfortunately
but there are also some pretty ridiculous sequence
this alec guinness starrer is a very good fun political satire of corporate industry ,
and none of it is really rolling-on-the-floor type funny
the stage version of a chorus line is wonderful .
val 's story is that she is a great dancer but a 3 in the looks department .
but ultimately she is a great dancer .
and is famous for looking great .
an imagination is a terrible thing to waste ...
writer/director jone wastes no time
easily one of the best animation/cartoon released in a long-time .
is a shockingly beautiful and profoundly touching film .
the acting was amazing ,
or even good intentions.this is definitely one of the best movie i have ever seen in my life
presents yet another beautiful performance .
that had both my favorite actress meryl streep and wynona ryder ,
after watching this lame movie and i still have the uise.first of all the character
( an actor i still admire even after this disappointment )
plays was just awful .
that this is a really lousy movie
and there was a lot of wasted talent here .
the location appeal as suitably boring and totally unlikely for the invasion of earth by martian .
has just great line .
but subtle and enjoyable it is .
this has to be the most utally unfunny `` comedy ''
that the only movie i have ever seen worse
worse .
that `` flan '' was a funny word
here a fun fact ,
strange and funny fact i suppose.. and no i am not a child actress .
this movie is a great movie
.i enjoyed this quite a bit ,
it will be even more enjoyable on dvd ,
not exactly master of subtlety .
i would like to see part four and five and six.zizek is very funny ,
in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly
.sure the main character get their bloody piece in a bad way ,
it is so lame it even gets boring ,
and really quick too.the worst thing
( if the above was not bad enough for ya )
by filming with cheap hand-held-camera .
which is just as bad as the rest ,
and vary from cheap euro-house to the worst grungy hard-rock ... my advise :
that gets stupid at some moment
but it is definitely not one of the best comedy ever or one of the best movie
he is a great comedian
but this is not his best movie .
the effect look cheap and ridiculous ,
this was a horrible attempt at inging this book to the screen .
this adaptation can only be compared to boring
fake and cheap motel-room art
which is interpreted in a funny way .
slightly worse than his usual .
movie is not hilarious or funny all the way or anything like that
and those moment are really hilarious.i recommend this fun and worth watching american with english cream comedy to all person
unless you want to be disappointed
of creating a bad movie cult classic ,
that was so absolutely awful
that it becomes fascinating in term of its fault ?
every one of the acting cast should be nominated for worst acting performance award .
i especially enjoyed the performance of the emma character .
without having to look at my watch every 5 minutes.i enjoyed the scene with the tooth fairy and the burning of her .
all in all an enjoyable night of movie watching .
which was imperfect but very enjoyable
and it was made in many part of beautiful paris.in this current film ,
they were caricature of the lowest sort.the very few humorous moment are all of a course sexual nature or quite insulting to the many fine new yorker
and toxic waste seep through to the nearby high school .
and thing really start to get messy .
this film suffer from a couple of really dull and overlong moment
a plot more complicated than complex.charle berling is not lucky with the genre ( see the astoundlingly dumb `` l'inconnu de strasbourg '' a couple of year ago ) .the scene with his pregnant wife -which are supposed to be a counterpart for the otherwise noir atmosphere of the rest of the plot-are among the worst ever filmed.add a steamy love scene between them and a gory autopsy
it is really the silence of the lame .
which is the best
that todd sheet ' zombie bloodbath is the absolute worst horror film i
this is one of the funniest movie i
it is an extremely funny movie
what a mess .
while still being pretty funny.there were a few clich\u00e9 's ,
and was not oh my gosh wonderful.it was just a movie
that you can sit down and enjoy for how enjoyable it was.i do not see how this movie was bad.it is rating is just a bit too low.i could have dealt with a 5.5
and there was nothing horrible enough
is another great season 1 episode .
the teaser is very fun with the close up of the eye and the reflection of the disco light .
this is one of my favorite season 1 episode in fact .
anyway i give the episode a 9/10 .
but anyway this is an excellent early talkie
well it was directed by a great french director
who had directed garbo in 1929 in `` the kiss '' .theo shall is excellent
as a good-hearted old cheap floozie.in all quite an experience ,
arthur bach one can not help but feel for this unique and wonderful character .
she was really excellent
the rest of the cast also excellent
truly this was one of the best comedy of the 1980s .
great film get better with each viewing
i loved
tony scott can make good film and bad ,
but this is quite possibly his best film.what makes this film
so great is that scott gives denzel
the set up is absolutely not boring ,
the time of her body 's perfection was short ,
with floriane 's self-absorption beautifully portrayed
as well as the equally beautiful union of marie and anne ,
who enjoyed `` the house by the cemetery ''
sadly
and the worst part is that her vision
but it also offers a nice variety of unintentionally funny moment ,
that make the movie unforgettable in a way .
the funniest thing however
looks creepy and funny at the same time too
it fits perfectly
will not be disappointed by this one .
in my book `` basic instinct '' was a perfect film .
music and the noirest noir script ever .
it can not possibly get worse ,
bad acting and a lame script ,
this is really bad
boring
annoying .
these copy are so bad
that is good in this horrible mess
i am sorry i have seen this awful film
so bad is it .
the only redeeming value is the realization
( and i am sure ms stone afforded the best surgeon money can buy )
but can obviously not restore the perfection of the original .
do not ever make a sequel to a perfect film !
and it falls squarely into the category of `` awesomely bad '' -
and i felt oh-so-bad at the poor guy from the production company
i will bullet point the worst part ; script :
the funniest
and worst part of this movie
it clunks along a linear and predictable road with the occasional ill-thought-out aside .
but eminently laughable.animation :
poorly done ,
it could possible be even more boring to watch solo than `` new world '' with colin farrell
as you will not be able to have a laugh at the ridiculousness with a friend or two .
because it was predictable ,
and to make thing worse there is a hot guy
no real surprise there.this whole movie was so damn predictable
this was so awful i nearly puked ,
you will be very disappointed.here are some of the logical inconsistency
that lead to that disappointment :
* the movie goes to great length
that will lead to a true sleuth aficionado 's disappointment .
'five day ' is a very weak british crime story .
unfortunately
are quite annoying
who 's character lacks so much development ,
there is at least a good twenty minute to thirty minute of wasted film
this one was a really boring one ,
you will be disappointed .
that was not completely bland and a few ok black magic spell
the plot was confusing and boring .
the character were thin and annoying ,
this is the worst asian horror movie
accompanied by the now stupid but lovable baldrick
throughout this third series to the wonderfully written sitcom blackadder try everything he can to get rich and powerful .
it won the bafta for best comedy series ,
and it was nominated for best design
and best make up .
and he was number 3 on the world 's greatest comedy character ,
was number 2 on britain 's best sitcom .
this would have to be one of the worst
if not the worst ,
purely and simply it is gratuitous violence just for the sake of it and the ridiculous story line only adds to the lacklustre and incompetent filming .
and its encouragement of violence and intolerance against all non-muslim is lacking objectiveness ,
and loved the movie .
and though it is not as funny as that movie ,
it was so incredibly disappointing ,
this film is extremely poorly made ;
from its writing to its directing to its hilariously horrible acting .
this movie falls short of conveying the overall intention of the play with the ridiculous musical sequence .
and other poorly cast role ,
but she was great
we both enjoyed it too the maximum - hilarious laugh - sadness about the `` realistic police- normalos '' .
much too short though ... it is one of my all time favorites - and i am aware of it
delirious was so funny.. i was in tear .
the best impression was of jame brown and mr t > so funny ! !
do not watch but amazing
and so funny.. i have seen it 6/7 time
which is real funny.if
because they had played in some of my favorite movie ever .
i was amazed at how great the story line actually was .
because it was not horrible at all .
the actor and actress played the part wonderfully and the way
it got just a small bit boring ,
with which he completes this function
unlike that film the fourth man is also perversely funny
the film is also full of both subtle and not so subtle visual symbolism
unfortunately
would have stunk just as badly as this barnyard animal
he talks badly aped received english to some other guy .
unfortunately hine ' effect are both crude and incompetent \u0096 tripod fighting machine higher than a cathedral spire stomp
we get the worst looking stuff used again and again .
whose dramas are played in unforgettable harmoney of emotional feedback .
and fantastic it became from start to end
definitely one of the best movie i have had the pleasure of watching .
where poor tom always gets the worst of it
some very good acting and some wonderful smile as well .
ok ... i watch a lot of bad movie .
many time there are some gem in the b rated bomb .
but this movie is one of the worst i have watched .
so you mean to tell me in this movie the bad guy win .
imagery bad thing about the movie :
that are influenced by film noir ,
but this is really his best work .
without being distracting and offers the perfect combination of suspense and dark humor .
it is too bad
that works best is the old fashioned way with an audience and indoor set .
that 70 's show is a great example .
played wonderfully by topher grace and ashton kushton
i liked the casting of tommy chong as the wasted
but beloved father figure to steven hyde .
i loved watching tanya robert besides charlie 's angel .
i loved brooke shield
who also created my other favorite show
`` cabin fever '' is a horrible film .
it turns funny .
the humor is quite bland ,
i was pretty disappointed and disgusted .
was that supposed to be funny ?
i did not find it funny
unfortunately
and even worse
do yourself a favor and avoid wendigo.personally
is the key to the film.one of the best thing
fessenden and director of photography terry stacey find some great shot in beautiful location ,
that this is perhaps one of the worst film with native content
uncreative attempt at utilizing portion of traditional coyote story and poor camera work were only made worse by the glib uncreative story-line and bad script .
the fact is that this movie differs so greatly from the original film
and has added some great new stuff as well
a terrible amateur movie director
this film and i use the term very loosely is so bad
that it is.. well bad .
the humor is painfully unfunny
now i have seen some atrociously awful 'horror ' film in my time
excellently made buddy film ,
rating- 10/10 .
since i was enjoying a wonderful ice-cream with nut during the whole movie .
it is cris reeve greatest role as clifford
one of the best actor of the last 50 year and in this film as good as he has ever been .
every single part of the film was awful .
i particularly loved the bit
and many scene are dull .
this film are not too bad ,
being made clear.i enjoyed this movie ,
great to watch late at night !
i give it a generous 7/10 .
beautiful ...
acting is great ,
before - but rarely
i was too young to see richard pryor during his greatest time ,
( not as funny )
funny
these day eddie murphy is boring and old \u0096
and 'delirious ' was the greatest castle ever built .
truly one of the funniest routine of all time .
or stupid .
this movie is literally the worst movie of all time .
bad .
plot = bad .
accent = bad
acting = bad
harp = bad
sex scene - bad/cringeworthy.still ,
how could such a good roll call of actor perform so badly ?
bad
bad
bad .
really was a dull guy .
this gem came along with 11 other movie ,
and this is easily the worst i have seen in a long time .
that its horrible .
at least that movie is so unbelievably bad
this is right at that cusp of no redeeming quality what so ever .
from the bad acting
and this was so bad
but the best performance throughout the whole movie is that of the actress who plays the title character .
i give it a 10/10 .
that dumbland ,
very stupid .
but in this stupidity can be a sort of ironic intelligence to it ,
and even an episode like with the guy 's friend coming over is funny more-so for the beavis and butt-head comparison
one of lynch 's very cheap
and one of the most harrowingly funny thing i have ever
all i hear about is how poorly the animation is done .
it was great to see her character transformation in this movie ,
this police procedural is no worse than many other of its era and better than quite a few .
but emerges as an enjoyable programmer .
the best thing
but without the tedious and painstaking effort of the `` lab boy '' ,
i enjoyed john mile
of reviving his dead son ... unfortunately ,
the movie is bad ,
7/10 .
this bizarre and implausible film was as ridiculous at the time of its release
by using cannibalism.unfortunately for the producer of this film the green message
was stupid then
but does contain a very unmemorable last film performance by the late and great edward g. robinson
the critic loved the film
he had rather have only the image and the wonderful soundtrack .
'annoying ' is generally not a term one would use
dangerous maybe but not 'annoying '
but nothing great .
the movie was not a waste except for some boring scene
who were laughable .
than any one could do.krista really is one of the best in such roles.she also enacted quiet well as the baddie in the last 5 minute ,
was not that good and this was not his best
the dialogue is abysmal and at time unintentionally funny
i found this movie a huge disappointment .
but i found the movie boring .
since the great duke ellington 's number is savagely chopped ,
( whose unfortunately fed horrible line
carl brisson 's acting is bland as melba toast
faced huge issue with the production code at the worst possible time
it is fun
or bad week .
but danny is having the worst week ever ,
maybe i was supposed to feel bad for her character ,
because she is annoyingly predictably portrayed as a female
who 's the worst of the worst .
that annoying dialog
and the more scott try to hard to be funny ,
but it becomes so predictable and uninteresting .
this was among my favorite movie .
the whole was rather funny than scary
each genre has its best and worst film .
`twin warrior ' is jet li 's best shaolin era flick
while `the evil cult ' is his worst .
while in the recent past is the best `modern era ' jet li movie .
without a doubt is the worst.jet li
the plot is just plain bad .
bad in its character interaction ,
unfortunately this is the film best
it is a true disappointment .
sadly `black mask ' proved to be an exception to that rule .
if you want to see jet li at his worst
this piece of garbage is the best proof
that the kid this day wants stupid gi joe version of good story ? ? ?
the looney tune are some of the most beloved character in history ,
but this piece of garbage is just an example of stupid corporate decision
the whole show is only a waste of time
this does not sound too bad
bad copy of flash
the were supposed to be funny ! ! ! !
too bad
despite the disappointing ending ,
as if they are coming from a great distance ,
midnight cowboy is an excellent film portraying the harsh reality of society
a wonderful film version of the best-selling book and smash broadway play about the life of sadie and bessie delany
excellently performed
heinkel and messerschmitt .
to avoid peace .
the ally wanted to steal the world 's greatest technology and scientist from the german and contain complete ownership through an `` unconditional surrender . ''
the ally wanted to steal the world 's greatest technology and scientist from the german
it is a poor film ,
the film is filled with laughable gore and fakey death scene .
while the practical mummy effect are not bad ,
they do the best
if you just want to watch a couple of your favorite firefly character
almost vomited at how stupid it was ...
it was not even funny stupid
which is sometime a fun movie
this is the worst slasher film i
as a showcase for beautiful girl working out ,
strong recommendation to avoid ,
which are laughable .
so how refreshing ! ! ! !
and that is a superb movie .
amazing
and i am really cheap .
particularly since i could have written funnier material
worse
it are not funny .
it was not funny then ,
and it sure are not funny now .
but even worse
where cheap laugh ,
the opening shot was the best thing about this movie ,
were there any redeeming value ?
and the girlfriend was realllllllllly bad .
it is mostly wasted
instead of simply showing racism for the ugly and stupid thing
rarely happens .
they do not make movie this bad very often
too bad .
but the final reveal does not make a great deal of sense
in fact it gets quite dull .
but i would recommend this movie for any parent wanting to inform their child in a fun way about the first moonwalk .
and this one effort by them is painfully unfunny ,
this movie is amazing .
a great british indy movie !
fantastic chemistry between the 3 main character make for some hilarious drug-fuelled set piece
loved the final fight scene with it is nod to zulu
what a terrible film.it starts well ,
the acting is not so much poor ,
but the script is pointless
despite the atmospheric music.it really is amazing
and i urge you not to waste a minute of your life on it !
is ok. this is a terrible adaption of it though.awful
( and i mean awful )
bad dialogue
and average cinematography make up this terrible adaption of hatchet.the film
banging his head to cheap 80s rock music )
his jacket was torn to shred but in the movie it is perfectly fine with no tear or rip
that knocked down several of his thing.my favorite part of this camp fest was brian 's lame flashback
that line out in the movie.there is a pathetic epilogue with brian
where he carved a message ,
so perfectly done :
`` this is so bad
perfect description of this movie.i would not recommend it to somebody
this is awful
and will ing down your thought on the book.1/10
this is a great
ridiculous horror movie
if you love 80s metal and bad movie ,
9/10 !
and i found the movie quite enjoyable to watch .
tremor iv can not be considered a bad movie ,
in fact it can not be even considered an epitome of a bad movie ,
there are cheaper way to find thing
of surfing to its perfect form ,
has edited ream of amazing stock and interview footage down to their essence
this is a wonderful documentary
arlene in the former is a beautiful
the integrity of the story is preserved by superior acting from howard and davis as well as fantastic steiner 's music
- max steiner wrote a beautiful leitmotif for each woman in phillip 's life ,
and a beautiful scene
considered to be too beautiful to play leading role in gone with a wind )
fascinating music and original editing ,
it is just a beautifully detailed surrealist journey.there is no real dialog ,
and fun
only a 9/10 from me
nonetheless provides a fantastic and entertaining drama for the audience .
ending with a perfect
and steve helps him out the best he can .
this is a really fun movie .
parker posey makes this movie great .
i have never been a great fan of her ,
there are subtle manerism
if you want good laugh and a fun time ,
so i was anticipating it greatly
my worst fear were
the movie was surprisingly watchable ,
my definition of a great movie is if you want to continue to see it over again .
great film .
certainly of the calie of `` beautiful mind '' great acting
when you try to help the poor ? ''
it was fun to bad-mouth the movie
as beautiful and sexy as ms. zadora is ,
( just so i can compare the great ab with shahrukh \u0096
after debating whether i should waste almost 3 hour on a meaningless movie i
i would again be subjected to meaningless story with bad acting .
it was a great movie with a good storyline about the vanishing tradition of our society .
that the acting was great and even
though the music score might not be considered the best ever ,
just like ajay devgan went from being a joke to a great actor
she is beautiful with a great voice
and they both did an excellent job
and had fun .
well ... 99 per cent of active russian audience is disappointed .
depriving them of one of the greatest and most iconic show of all time .
and it is not just the dated artwork or terrible dialogue .
it lacks style
timeless and beautiful self .
interesting but not fantastic photography
poor and at time confused storyline
with poor dialogue
while laura comes across as a very naive and weak victim .
the ending is so terrible and `` hollywoodized ''
when they started the annoying music under every scene ,
hope the numb3rs are fun .
but the story was just so weak .
and the portrayal of lincoln was even weaker .
that was just stupid .
and makes me laugh can be bad but this vivid and silly story was just so ridiculous
it great.i have no idea
it was like a terrible practical joke .
the graphic where good the story line seemed solid
and it had all the trapping of a great movie .
director and all the actor great job
if a bit bland and the acting was good enough
`` was it as stupid as revolver ? ''
jason stratham would have been amazing
this movie could have been worse
the color is lush and wonderful to look at ,
how good/bad/strange/ is it ?
.it never fails to make me laugh .
boring
funny
now that in itself does not make for a bad film .
mady is rather disappointed by this development
( unfortunately
he will get help.there is a fantastic twist to this
the production value are terrible ,
and the whole undertaking is just lame
it amazing this was even released .
avoid at all cost
1/10 .
refreshingly free from clich\u00e9
the tethered pair are seen to be a great deal alike in their response to form of rejection
with all footage shot in a beautiful autumnal ontario province .
this film has jack nicholson and shelly duvall at their best .
so if you are looking for a great movie ,
this is the epitome of a good thing gone bad .
this one was for the worst ,
has been replaced by an obviously cheaper
it rate a 3.2/10 from ... the fiend : .
the screenplay by daniel taradash kept the best quality of the fine theatrical play
the technical production was beautiful
wonderful comedienne elsa lanchester and hermione gingold as fellow witch and lovely kim novak in one of her most touching part as gillian .
jimmy stewart was the imperfect element in my judgment ;
but director richard quine used subtle lighting ,
a lovely ending to this beautifully-photographed and unusual romance makes its amazing realism
funny
two excellent cameraman and too much russ .
he is funny ,
great stuff ! the series wraps up in 7 episode .
predictable parody ,
like jonathan ross ' enjoyable profile of romero on 'the incredible strange film show . '
layered and beautiful .
that his dark nature makes him fundamentally at odd with the world ,
there is also great use of lighting and fog
though i found this to be a pretty great film ,
that song was nominated for best song ,
and rat are scampering all over and naked body are being enjoyed.kitty
the color is superb in this thriller from emilio miraglium ,
it was like watching a really bad buddy movie from the early sixty .
but this was a major disappointment
scalise blames the murder on ken paine
if you like film noir ,
brokedown palace is the story of two best friend
the movie chose to focus little on the girl ' situation and more on their friendhip.claire dane and kate beckinsale both turn in excellent performance ,
the jealousy
i enjoyed it .
the soundtrack was perfect ,
excellent acting
but it is maybe his funniest !
not because the story is so weak .
it is full of great name of american cinema
4/10
the joke were lame
a bland piece of crap .
a pretty awful problem happened
i was very disappointed in this 1970 film
the female character and the cosmeticly perfect actress who are chosen to portray them .
too bad !
i enjoyed it .
immortal beloved ) .
great story and character .
the acting is wonderful as leonardo dicaprio
the song after so long has become annoying
which is memorable but in a bad way
and does not try to avoid saying so .
this film is soooo lame .
lame effect
she is a lousy rival for helen hunt 's character -
at least the wonderful plot device of the `` long second watch '' is back in place ,
hooray for lousy continuity !
this is a really bad film ,
with bad acting and a very boring pace lorenzo lamas is really cool though ! .
all the character are just annoying
plus the action is very boring .
it looks very cheap and amateurish ! .
however the middle is incredibly boring ,
plus the dialog is especially laughable ! .there is a cool bar scene
this is a really bad film ,
with bad acting and a very boring pace ,
the direction is very bad .
george erschbamer does a very bad job here
with mediocre camera work
bland location ,
and keeping the film at a boring pace .
the acting is pretty bad
he is quite fun to watch ,
josie bell is terrible here ,
she did okay at that.robert scott is incredibly annoying as the main villain ,
he was laughable
as were the other 2. rest of the cast are bad .
overall avoid !
avoid ! ,
i cringed at the appallingly predictable plot
the lame acting and laughed at moment
paltrow 's a beautiful woman
and make a mess of the living room .
but he does not seem to suffer much pain from this.dirty work is stan and ollie at their funniest .
great fun.rating :
is a wonderful director
the screenplay is so predictable
this film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror film
even though it would never be great .
the special effect are pretty cheap ,
it is boring
cheap
and bad .
amazing piece of work .
steven spielberg created a wonderful movie
it just wonderful .
one of the most unheralded great work of animation .
the `` accidental nightmare '' sequence is doubtless one of the best piece of animation ever filmed .
are certainly portraying bad part of hong kong
that `` the pillow book '' is insulting the japanese culture and the hong kong environment .
yet boring film .
the animation is fantastic in the big picture
thought were wonderful .
but the weak story and the empty character stood in the way of that .
acting is great
and makes no mistake here.an excellent film all round .
this guy continues being an excellent actor
an excellent actress has become and i congratulate her .
it is excellent .
my vote is 10/10
but i will not waste my time
but i still enjoyed it .
one of my favorite episode is where jesse
how what made it so funny ,
another one of my favorite episode is where jesse
i found the 1971 version quite boring .
it is not all that great .
( boring )
i loved her as sara deever
who the `` best actress '' award was going to .
unfortunately aileen
is the more sympathetic character .
you will be missing out on one of the best performance of recent year .
mr. blanding builds his dream house may be the best frank capra/preston sturge movie
or it is a wonderful life - movie
every pointless bit of business here is fawned over for four
this cinematic crater is and will remain the very worst canadian movie of all time .
and the character perform were great .
unfortunately all of the life was taken out of the story .
i have never seen such an awful portrayal of mr. rochester .
all of his most fundamental trait are gone .
based on the wonderful music and cinematography
he looks great
bad moon
but his acting is also superb.isabelle adjani with her big glass is wonderful.the landlord ,
monsieur zy is played by the great melvyn douglas.jo van fleet
play madame dioz.the fantastic shelley winter is the concierge.the tenant is something very scary from time
but that makes it all so fascinating .
i enjoyed watching brigham young
it is an incredible story of a strong and devoted person.as a member of the church
it is rare to see a love story
was great as the woman so full of life
unfortunately ,
michael is an incredible artist ,
watch the movie.moonwalker is fun for the first half hour ,
not that it is not a great song ,
the story was incredibly weak :
that is incredible
this music video is perfection ,
michael always goes above and beyond perfection and smooth criminal was incredible .
i loved moonwalker as a kid ,
i still watch it for fun to this day ,
but it is not the best movie by any mean ,
if you are a michael jackson fan as well.7/10
the lady man is laugh out loud funny
with a great diverse cast as well
as having some very stupid but excellent scene
( including the funniest love song ever written )
plays an idiot surprisingly well
and has written himself some of the funniest line
king is a great writer ,
there is nothing terrible about the film ,
and the slightly forced ending seems to eak the rule of this genre a little.there are worse way to spend 90 minute of your life ,
who overcome real problem in a beautiful setting .
recommended for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change .
it is perfectly acted
but what really matter is the simple and wonderful message .
even the theme song alone is funny .
because it is easier to give a cheap thrill
( however quite why it has been given a `` worst film '' razzie
there was a thousand worse film
perfect cast for a few-person drama .
but a bit slow and somewhere even boring .
this is the funniest stand up i
it is the funniest i will ever see .
then you are missing out on one of the best stand-ups ever .
george carlin or even the great like richard pryor or red foxx and this will surpass it .
it is funny as hell.could you imagine
and it is still the funniest damn thing on video . ''
and be prepared to laugh your freakin ass off ! 10/10
i give this movie a 2/10 star
they make one of the worst movie couple .
and the movie messed it up so horribly ,
2/10
my goodness is this movie bad .
bad guy wear black ...
a bad guy wants a sweet girl
or they have sold their soul to the devil.rachael mcadam is beautiful ... .yup ,
not a horrible one ... she is just cute .
you have loved one in danger
amazing .
but then rarely did actual teenager play actual teenager .
so `` the blob '' is not without a modicum of subtlety .
which might best be described as rebel
it was bad enough
the movie is teeny bopper at its teeny bopping best .
that these boring character personally witnessed every significan not moment of the 1960
this movie was still unbelievably awful .
`` the sweetest thing '' is both vulgar and unforgivably stupid ) ;
that it somehow comes off as a delightful little gem .
the movie is very entertaining and highly enjoyable :
it was never boring .
the acting is terrible .
as a whole is depressing and disappointing ; 3 )
and 5 ) this is a really bad movie .
expect to be disappointed
unfortunately this is not quite accurate .
all the piece are there - the beautiful backdrop
sound good but unfortunately nothing is up to par .
the married couple and the little sister are particularly poor and uninvolving .
unfortunately when mediocre character acting is combined with a classical `` chekovian ''
very predictable ) plot
the result are at best tedious and at worst painful .
a principle of darkness and opacity functioning as a sort of projective space for the desire and fear of the viewer .
hundstage deal with these matter as a function of the everyday ,
( a rare thing on television ) ,
great writing
wonderful camera-work
so bitterly disappointed .
the film was directed so badly
the dialogue laughable and the film - well apart from a nice fight scene between achille
and it did not even look as if the two of them cared a great deal about the other .
eric bana and peter o ' toole acted very well with a bad script
to save this awful movie .
maybe in all the tree they used for the funeral pyre -
so disappointed it hurts .
the `` shootout '' in the staircase is one of the most train-wreck funny scene ever .
when at his best
unfortunately
woody is the best at being woody .
this type of thing only pulls the audience out of the story.my favorite woody allen movie
that is not the best film ever ,
it was so boring .
but i am still angry that i waste my time with this film .
the character were not stupid ,
these character were some of the most flawed and stupid character ever .
the only likable character - lisa - made one of the most stupid move in the movie .
( i can not even remember his name- is that bad ?
and the reaction was bad .
very bad .
expect bad leg for this one .
that the film is never quite as funny
it is messy
if the film is supposed to be character-driven the poor lighting does not enhance the acting
unfortunately bunny chow will not be remembered as one of the ight light of the south african new wave ,
but some of the remarkable film about our apartheid history will indeed be rated among our best in our 110 year old film history .
which of course is not funny
the movie is great
how many time do we have to see bad horror movie with a killer in a scream-ripoff mask ?
the dialogue is poorly developed ,
it is boring
and wastes too much time on trivial detail ,
the acting is bad
this rental stink worse than a skunk .
that was the best and the 1ton saetooth walking on its front leg hilarious
it i loved it
the plot was wonderful
and unique as well with an excellent moral to the story.this movie is definitely not for someone looking for a sex romp
this is a wonderfully poignant film
have seen even a great number with high box office earnings.i highly recommend this movie .
this was the worst gay-themed film i
this is the worst film
the audio track is so bad in many scene
bad lighting
bad photography
poor script
generally bad acting all add up
i did make it through to the bad ending after several attempt ,
do not try to palm off this lame attempt as a finished product .
whose life has been fascinating but ultimately directionless
`` your worst enemy are hiding
but once you see the clear message and the ability
( two of my favorite film of his ) ,
that this was not lee 's favorite film .
but lee crafted an amazing film out of one man 's journey into the unknown .
were two great scene in this film
this was a very bad movie ,
that was probably lost in the shuffle due to the remaining poor scene .
jude law gives his all in this beautifully filmed vampire flick
but despite their best effort ,
as being representative of gram.i can not say enough bad thing about this movie .
went to see the movie with great anticipation - of course
it would be a great rgv treat ,
you could play a fun game with friend :
raj is in fact not bad
i was really disappointed with amitabh bachchan as babban ,
who could find redeeming value in this piece of crap ought
because otherwise what a waste of expensive film it would be .
it was a tossup as to which one was worse .
scott wilson and robert blake are excellent as the killer
the landmark photography is by the great conrad hall .
and the beginning of a short lived love/jealousy problem.tess harper and sam waterston round out the cast .
could do worse
achingly beautiful in its exultation of small thing ,
it would have been worse
so i will part you with my favorite line :
and begins to mess with pierce.at one stage pierce is innocently making `` vegeburger '' .
other time the lighting was so bad
to tell her of mr. elliot 's awful character
it is too bad .
but she was completely hamstrung by a poorly organized script and an over-truncated production .
because i am not a big fan of vampire and the sound of the director 's name deran serafian usually means bad news .
check it out ... my humble opinion on to die for = 8.5/10
competent and entertaining and the rest of the extra are excellent
and the mansion goes up in flames.this senseless mess is too dark ,
boring and the stupid dialogue never matches the lip .
`` you are the dumbest smart person
i absolutely loved this soap .
it has been one of my favorite .
i loved the character
the best soap i have ever seen .
even despite the great cast --
.if not for the terribly funny aspect
who sees great potential in the spirited girl
it is about how love can overcome even the worst tragedy in life as portrayed in song and style and the character
or had exploding message
it sounds lame with out the 's ' .
of course this is not laugh out loud funny ,
it is not `` so bad it is good ''
it is so bad i would rather be poked in the eye with a sharp stick
calling this a cult film is an insult to true cult classic like repo man
it was dam funny !
too bad
that that show is on bad time for me .
and he comes on stupid idea .
the stupidest guy on whole group
probably stupidest in town and his a cop !
he is so stupid
to take the 'message ' of the bible
it is quicker than sitting through this waste of celluloid.poor acting
you could not really put this into the 'so bad
but it is entertaining.surprisingly ,
including a very weak performance by one of my favorite up and comer
is just a token love interest with hardly any screen time.can a series of beautiful car and the car chases
they become involved in make a great film ?
but this is not one of my favorite .
and most of the rest of it is person engaging in a lot of poorly-written
it was fun to see steve m. and anita c. together ,
is ridiculous .
it was a technically poorly made movie .
i really enjoyed this thriller !
the cast was excellent ,
and it was just an overall enjoyable movie !
as one of the best thriller i have ever seen !
and the `` surprise '' ending is nothing but a bad joke on the audience ,
and direction are uniformly awful .
but is never funny
the overall affect is of massive stupidity with a nasty twist .
wanda nevada is a complete waste of time
self-destructive and thoroughly annoying .
for example.all of the witty satire on the class system etc was wasted
the show 's best-known song is `` cocktail for two . ''
the biggest disappointment in this film was that
i expected the acting instructor of the cast to eak in and apologize for how poor the acting was .
in creating a wonderful set and spectacular image ,
the whole biker movie genre has to be made up of the worst film
the acting is beyond terrible .
this film is one of the best of all time
actor are fantastic ,
you were fantastic as dr loomis ,
which of course is one of the film best scene .
i loved this film
and that is what makes the film enjoyable .
that is made into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere .
as well as psycho 's superb storyline ,
there format are the best horror has to offer .
to me halloween and psycho are the best film i
halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movie of all time .
this superb film draws on a variety of talented actor and musician at the top of their form - levant
the acting and story are wonderful
on screen over the next few years.miss eisenberg has developed from a cute face into a strong young actress with charm and wonderful comic delivery .
that this is one of the best thing
generally boring !
of it is a wonderful life .
i also thoroughly enjoyed bad santa .
i like excellent
`` fred '' is a perfectly ok holiday movie
not a great flick
but my wife and daughter and i enjoyed it for what it was
on british channel 5. it is fascinating to think
or be watched and loved world-wide .
i loved this film
the acting of said badly chosen cast
that was not that great to start with ,
and even that would not have saved this horrible piece of film-making.stay out of hazzard !
some horrendously bad
but some of the film seems awfully prescient .
it is the unforgettable movie about two adult and two spunky kid on an adventure for fun .
it was bad ,
age 7 year and up will enjoy this wonderful
one of the very best thing
unforgettable and so understandable .
it is really annoying
great work paxton .
though the plot is very weak ,
it is truly one of the worst
is horrible .
and the sex scene are downright lame .
it is busy repulsing you.just awful .
putting aside the religious message ,
where he played a weak character .
was wonderful and tender .
valerie bertinelli was excellent and lovely as usual and very believable in this role .
if you like everything to be perfect and make sense ,
avoid this one .
it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous .
`` magnolium '' has a lot of great acting .
`` this is stupid ! ''
scrappy-doo is about the most annoying and awful character
the bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny
annoying and grate on the nerve
it would have been better to just end the franchise than create this mess !
if this attitude is `` avant-garde '' or just `` stupid . ''
while watching the dvd.this is quite possibly the worst film to ever
it is rather poor .
but the film is just boring at time with so much dancing and dancing and dancing .
with overblown production number and a weak story
to make matter worse ,
even more amazing to me is that `` ace in the hole '' lost for best writing
hoffman is superb
played perfectly by marisa tomei
but it was awful .
i can not imagine why helen mirren and other were part of this degrading mess .
like i stated before its a degrading mess .
its not even funny .
more than likely you will see it as an extra feature on some cheap `` 4 movie on 1 dvd '' compilation at wal-mart for five buck .
this is the worst ripoff of home alone movie
but still creepy and fun ... .even so ,
some of the episode were great .
my personal favorite was `` it is a miserable life ''
that was my favorite.some of the episode were much dumber ,
painfully bad christmas film
`` bahumbag '' at how unfunny this film is and after another 30 minute ,
involved in this mess
rachel weisz ings a sense of fun and spirit to her role
you have a very unevenly bad film
that the white actor playing chinese was not as bad
it was not the greatest performance i have ever seen
that the timing of the release during the great depression sort of turn this film into an allegory .
and he taunts a stalker armed with a flamethrower with `` how about a light ? ''
it is funny stuff !
this movie serves as a great parody of today 's `` reality tv '' craze .
this is a fun film
9/10 !
penelope keith is perfect as aunt louise
this is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find word to condemn it .
loveday has changed from the young woman
this is definitely one of the greatest disney movie
( my all-time favorite actor )
it is a wonderful family movie .
if you enjoyed this movie ,
i give this movie a solid 9/10 !
using great writing and great actor
the series is aloud to progress in a satisfyingly unpredictable and exceptional way .
the series also boasts a great collection of regular
michael imperioli and steve van zandt are great secondary character
( great !
robert loggia and frank vincent.the sopranos is a great family drama and a realistic interpretation of modern day mafia society
it is very rare that i complain something
and walked away very very disappointed .
avoiding the trap
but the best and worst movie i have seen
`` little miss sunshine '' being the best
and this movie being the worst .
it the ending is on of the worst ending in the history of cinematography !
and the whole concept was fascinating .
character died for stupid reason ,
and honestly ask yourself is it good to have only four guy left in the world ; its pointless and stupid .
because it looked like a fun movie .
but the movie was confused and pointless ...
this is not a fun romantic comedy
a serious waste of time.b
and the best sword fight since flynn and fairbank were in their heyday ?
i loved it .
john hurt and tim roth were great villain .
this must be one of the worst swedish movie ever made .
that such a bad script was allowed to become a movie
so what the tv audience see is not the best comic in the us.if the comic do make it to the show ,
helena did an amazing job in it !
the movie was also really funny too !
the joke were great !
bar none- worst episode ever .
where we seemed to be part of the great philippine 'i shall return ' landing scene
gregory peck triumphed in his portrayal of the great general
and newhart is quite funny .
cesar romero and robert morley pop up in some funny cameo .
the excellent music score is by laurie johnson .
unfortunately
diane lane and ellen barkin are at their most beautiful
then there is the great `` bullshit '' scene between barkin and jeff goldblum
this film is both subtle and bald .
and how funny the script can be ,
that have seen and enjoyed the original cube ,
it is a neat little psychological thriller with very interesting concept and a certainty about its own message .
but only really resulting in making a mess of what never needed fixing.what this new film has to offer ,
are not awful .
dark look to the film akin to such film noir as 'the matrix ' and 'dark city ' ,
never finding a solid
it is too bad
as two actor has shown great performance
set in japan about a dysfunctional family
that panders to the worst element in society
it is funny ,
have a great summer : )
the best of last year ... there are small thing
predictable
that the acting is not all that bad ,
that it is all too predictable ,
2. david lynch typically takes great pride in audio
because at least that idea is funny .
which mostly fails to capture the atmosphere of the character 's world and wholly fails to take the character anywhere
the actor was not at his best ) .
however the movie was just plain bad .
it was boring
but this one was refreshing
fun to watch ,
this is a great example of that .
its amazing
and i find it so ironic that my 2 favorite tv show of all time star richard dean anderson .
and considered it one of my favorite sci-fi flick ,
i am disappointed to hear
maybe even better.this show is amazing ,
this film has some of the greatest comedic dialog and memorable quote ever assembled in one film !
which worked so well in classic film such as the bad seed
young girl blames a load of person for the death of her mother ,
that it is boring !
the maker have chosen the best person for the job ,
and set the scene wonderfully .
but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive .
( great 30s film starring gable and harlow )
that has been so badly underrated
that it is amazing ! `the invisible ray ' is part horror
drama and sci-fi are a perfect blend ,
the scene with the gargoyle outside of lugosi 's room is a perfect example of the mood .
which is so sadly missing in today 's movie of the genre.as with `the black cat ' and `island of lost soul ' ,
that was at least mildly entertaining.the original `` basic instinct '' was no great film
this lame-ain ,
is she as beautiful
and whatnot.the rest of the performance range from bad to terrible
so bad person were laughing at certain moment
the whole plot is a cosmic mess and the ending
talk about stupid and unbelievable .
( still predictable
when his favorite wussy 'metal ' singer
this movie is utterly laughable
rating `` 10/10 '' master piecesome year ago
nothing is perfect ,
but this movie - together with schindler 's list - is your best .
that man sometimes could be bestial
rarely are they both negative character totally .
where they are both extremely sympathetic but at cross purpose
she is best remembered as basil rathbone 's frightening sister
this is a fascinating account of the hunt for the soviet union 's first known serial killer .
the acting by the whole cast is also superb
their convincing portrayal give their character arcs a great deal of credibility ,
the festival highlights some of the best independent and non-mainstream film from the past year .
that `` the big bad swim '' was chosen for screening at this festival for the simple reason
could only think about how well `` the big bad swim ''
`` who killed the electric car '' and `` transamerica '' .the `` the big bad swim '' is an engaging
the interweaving character development and plot line derived from something as absurd as adult-swimming lesson work in subtle and endearing way
which i found refreshing .
if `` the big bad swim '' is not picked up for some kind of distribution i would extremely disappointed .
`` the big bad swim '' need to be seen .
disappointment is impossible !
this was an incredible out-of-print work from the master of comedy
i was soon to be disappointed .
who enjoyed it ,
but the majority of the funny came from the music videos
that this was not al 's greatest video achievement
most of which is tedious ,
that actually kind of work and the actor do not play it too badly
and is as fun to watch as ever
the space sfx are not too bad
the most annoying aspect
of it all though is the really awful and usually inappropriate pop music
and only detracts from what is only average at best.basically an okay watch is you are up for something cheesy ,
that is great !
but what is the bad news ? producer :
that is ridiculous !
but bad writing ,
they might have been trying for the tired old `` do not let anything hold you back '' message
i loved that scene .
raised in the 1970's-80 's would want to.it rate a 7.4/10 from ... the fiend : .
episode in funny order ,
was a great combination of giallo and gothic horror - and this second film is even better !
the female side of the cast is excellent with the stunning barbara bouchet and marina malfattus heading up an eye-pleasing cast of lady
who love a mix of both genres.eric stoltz does an amazing job
it is one of frankenheimer 's best and most underrated film
and it is easily the best elmore leonard adaptation to date
`` but i loved get shorty ''
elevates the story 's sleaze factor to amazing height .
for reference purpose my favorite leonard book are :
my favorite frankenheimer film include second and the manchurian candidate .
his joke are great ,
the 70 's were not a *great* period for special effect ,
what you have is a fun series
but then gave way to a simply pathetic ending .
great idea for a film ,
but sadly 'cut ' is just another wasted opportunity.unfortunately australium has not had the world 's best track record
is best left forgotten .
is probably one of the most boring and uncharismatic villain in horror movie history .
lame one-liner would make the dialogue of a porno seem like shakespeare .
hyper-cinema during the `` research '' sequence just look lame ,
ronald colman won a best actor oscar for showy performance as a popular stage thespian
unfortunately
this scenario is awfully obvious
surprisingly draggy
this is one of the best animated film i have ever seen .
why sequel is doing such great business at the box office .
'' is excellent
just seemed so ridiculous .
deedee pfieffer 's performance was awful i thought .
but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting
it remains the worst movie i have ever seen.before seeing this ,
one of my regret will be the time i wasted
and cypher is refreshing for that reason .
that just fits this movie.cypher is far from perfect as some of the sequence are illogical and at time it can be inconsistent ;
recommended for fan of the original 'emmanuelle ' ,
the dialogue is utterly ridiculous .
i could go on for an eternity on the bad aspect of this movie ,
it is fairly safe to call this disaster `` mst3k worthy '' .
this is an excellent overlong runtime of jeremy brett-holme series .
however is a greatest villain ,
a perfect counterpoint of brett .
sad waste of time.willem dafoe is excellent actor .
peter stormare is an excellent actor .
slow does not make the movie bad ,
it was just bad .
which was even more disappointing . )
it is just too bad
because after 45 minute of pure boredom and stupidity i turned the channel .
put these two `` actor '' in a stupid movie and the result is twice as bad .
yes i have rated this film as one star awful .
this truly is so bad
buys a really cheap/bad mexican movie ,
mechanical wind-up reindeer and some of the most pathetic child actor i have ever seen bar none .
( an excellent performance by the debutante helena dubiel )
all in all a very disappointing film ,
we loved school of rock and jack black .
the movie was so bad i wanted to walk out .
the only funny part were in the trailer .
the writing was awful .
it had every terrible stereotype of hispanic person
there would maybe be some redeeming part ,
not from laughing but from the memory of a great rodney dangerfield movie .
easy money had him at his best ,
the script is so poor
the movie looks like it was shot on video with some really poor stunt sequence
but the poor man is getting way too old
which thank to the horrible 1990 's ,
( probably v. v. cheap )
.the cheap synth soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre .
( does not seem quite so funny in retrospect
murdered etc and surrounded by bad person in an obviously depressing environmant find something
non judgemantal director ,
with an evident will to nurture him into their beloved practise and hopefully become a good role model .
it all looks great
the subject matter keeps lot of person away from a funny and heart-warming film .
they made a worse film
just pathetic .
a poor man ,
witness him changing from poor slob to horny jerk .
just a simple ( subtle )
there are many great bit in this movie
the best moment for me are the kung fu u scene as well as the great moment
but it is also very funny mainly
the story in general is pretty lame and eugene levy and joe flaherty
and the great scene
william friendkin was the perfect person
despite being a great actor ,
who to make the movie and the story great .
but it is also completely enjoyable as a light
and have fun doing it .
these day it is just refreshing to go to a movie
stereobland
it is a true gem .
when asked about my favorite film
a stupid lame attempt at a tele-movie .
was totally weak
the wolf contact he wore were great ,
the sex scene was lame too .
weak plot
this is by far one of the worst and least
if you see it you waste time
it is not only the same lame film-as-art speech all over again .
surprisingly well made little movie .
cast is excellent especially elizabeth van meter as the girlfriend with tourette 's syndrome .
starsky and hutch was also enjoyable ,
especially when the scenario was not quite so funny
before - and very rarely successfully .
enjoyable and fresh comedy ,
he is asked to play a fuller role than the ridiculous character of his zoolander eed of movie ,
and generally becoming tedious .
the last annoying element of the movie is christopher walken 's role as 'the j man ' ,
it would be quite enjoyable ,
that this movie was great or even good is either delusional
and it was horrible .
because it is such a horrible rip-off of the story .
that we are very fortunate to be perfectly healthy ,
i was really disappointed.ram gopal varma ki aag does not come anywhere close to the real sholay .
ram gopal varma fails to create chemistry between the character .
ajay and sushmita sen was trying their best but no use .
rajpal yadav 's voice modulation - ineffective and rather pointless .
he messed up
i loved her show stopping performance in the five heart beat ,
like i was watching a bad college kid act for the first time in a student film .
but not horrible
( even though it was poor judgement on his part as well ) .
i would avoid this at all cost .
dick tracy is easily the best comic book
al pacino does a wonderful job of his own adaptation of big boy caprice and madonna is memorable as breathless .
that it was the best slasher movie
this is the perfect blend of 80 's and 90 's horror .
this is definitely a move in the right direction.denise richard stands out here as a fun character .
i loved her in this movie .
i watch them all.it is not better than the amazing one
as the other step movie i have seen were so american.i loved
i loved
i enjoyed the stepping routine .
very badly made film ,
the action/violence scene are ridiculous.1 point for the presence of burton and mastroianni + 1 point for the real tragic event of the massacre of the innocent italian :
2/10 .
predictable from beginning to end .
`` the incredible mr. limpet '' was much better ,
even leslie nielsen was a bad fit here ,
it is very disappointing .
otherwise you risk boring them
this film was a big disappointment.i take the opposite view of the critic .
who was a great comedy actor ,
but in one of his poorest performance
how bad it really was
i was horrified that i wasted what seemed like 4 hour of my life
i was surprised at how a movie could be both cheesy and excellent at the same time .
seinfeld had 9 amazing season with great writing ,
then got worse at the 100th time
it is truly awful .
it is a great film with a great message
to see how great and realistic movie can be
i especially loved the dance sequence during his showbiz stint .
the music and cinematography is great .
and gives a great performance .
brandon alexander gives a great comedic performance
as clitarissa pink.the worse
they wanted what is best for the movie .
is blacklisted in hollywood.the most ridiculous thing about the movie
probably the best thing about this movie
at a fun fair .
( the great gordon harker )
this is an excellent film
that will not disappoint you.highly recommended .
it was the perfect movie to watch in the mood
plot is awfully boring .
dull movie
but few and not very funny anyway .
sniggering at how pathetic it is )
( complete with the shrill annoying voice )
and simply bad mouth ppl all movie long .
i have been disappointed just like many person in the audience ...
i rated it 2/10
the audio for the first few minute was terrible with sound out of sync and segal voice not even his ! ! ! !
when the audio sync was better in about 5 minute the poor plot ,
even if it does not go so low to actually be funny and achieve cult status as a comedy ,
gandalf can be funny talking korean ,
but the truth is that his film actually are not bad at all .
the re-animator sequel are not as great as the original ,
but it shows yuzna 's eye for horror excellently ,
but surprisingly ; i would appear to be in the minority .
the dentist offers a refreshing change for ninety slasher movie .
this for me was a wonderful introduction to the talent and beauty of marion davy .
adds to the overall fun .
a great movie and must see for heavy metal hairband fan
i loved this movie
and loved to play rambo on it .
man this movie is really bad !
it is just so amazingly predictable .
the variety of character is amazing
i enjoyed the relationship between the lead
i also enjoyed the mix of humour
it was a great step up from eave ' other effort
as keira knightley plays the role of cocky badass bounty hunter domino harvey and even her dialogue seems strangely choppy .
otherwise she plays her poorly
that the story is told at an amazingly rapid-fire pace
there are some funny joke ;
it is a mess ,
but it is a rather enjoyable mess .
i give it a weak 7/10
and executed them well.7/10
this is the best stand-up show
this is his best work .
was just plain terrible .
much of `` over her dead body '' is so painfully unfunny
that she can not carry a film in this terrible romantic comedy ,
she is grating and annoying as a ghost
unfortunately
that can not get funded
because vast amount of money are being funneled into bland crap like this .
how stupid do they really think
kyser and his band mate are incredibly obnoxious
the great supporting cast was given a back seat
and fan of these actor will probably be disappointed.the film involves kyser
it is passable entertainment at best .
`` sound 's great !
it is stupid patriotic jargon
than our country is in much worse shape than i ever imagined .
i had expected something along the line of cheesy melodrama and bad special effect
like the movie is an insult to your intelligence .
displays the worst acting i
that i wasted nearly two hour of my life watching this movie !
this was a best-selling novel is incredible ,
the good news is that this is done so cheaply
not recommended for anyone with a 3-digit iq .
they would get a glimpse of what i loved as a child .
how bitterly disappointing .
a waste of film .
jimmy stewart is a special favorite of mine .
this movie was a lot of fun to watch ,
and i enjoyed it thoroughly .
( even though slightly different and also a very enjoyable film . )
great overall storyline
great camera work
but the first is still the best overall movie .
tom berenger does a great job
the wonderful set
super action and the best stunt forever .
and lau ching-wan is a great co-actor .
of course the movie has the typical hk-fun.but i love it !
this documantary by marian cooper is absolutely amazing .
it has bad dialogue badly
performed in a meandering and trashy story.as badly
as it fails as art ,
it fails even worse as commerce .
have seen thousand of bad movie ,
who fell from grace '' and `` mano '' ... my choice as the three most unredeemably bad movie i have ever seen .
and make it worse ?
in this case it is used in the worst possible sense
worse the vo also explains what is happening on the screen !
( not incredible
but fails to entertain
to stop from commenting on the terrible writing
cheering at the rather clumsy but basically uplifting scene and gasping at the insanely obvious and predictable tension scene ,
those were poorly done ) ,
unfortunately
because of how incredible it was --
when a beautiful woman named simone picard
it is hackman who gives the weak and uninvolving performance ,
while hill raises his game to surprisingly high level .
but the pacing is awfully slow
maurice jarre 's music is uncommonly flat too \u0096 very disappointing from the guy
sadly
the special effect and the writing are all about as bad
the plot is sooooooo predictable .
that the majority of the movie going public is stupid .
the romance in clive cussler novel was weak .
the hell with the girl and the stupid piece of paper .
1/10 garbage
( a wonderfully over-the-top michael caine )
( a solid reeve )
( superbly played by cannon )
and you have got yourself a wonderfully funny suspense flick.while not up to `` sleuth '' standard ,
but overall `` deathtrap '' is solid
well acted and suspenseful fun .
and the poor soul
this is still a superb film .
this time with a superb cuban accent .
so pacino 's performance i suppose is perfect for the film .
as usual and mary elizabeth mastrantonio makes a great debut
it does not have the subtlety of the godfather film ,
this really is the worst colour movie
that can be funny to watch ,
so bad they are good
and seeing bad movie just makes you want to go out there
but watching this just made me feel sorry for whoever made it.as bad
and was disappointed in the evity of her bath scene .
an excellent end to an excellent series !
the best cop show with the best writing and the best cast on televison .
the end of a great era .
she could have avoided him this long .
the achingly funny characterisation
ossessione is in very bad state
this film is beautiful
the restoration effort will be enjoyed by many generation to come .
have not seen dysfunctional family
so it would be pointless for that person to do so .
( 1999 ) was pathetic and find me guilty was an interesting
lumet ings his best film in decade and
this film is like a rebirth for lumet.this movie has an excellent story which
i think the ending of the movie is perfect.the performance are illiant.philip seymour hoffman ings
one of the best actor of our days.ethan hawke is also an excellent actor but he is underrated by my point of view.his performance in here is great.the rest of the cast is also excellent
the great albert finney )
which were sadly ignored by the pathetic oscars.the film
is a real masterpiece with perfect direction
a great screenplay and excellent performance.we need more movie like this .
it is an annoyingly repetitive story now :
which he project all manner of perfection .
everyone lives in perfect gigantic apartment in great manhattan neighborhood ,
during which all the character relate fascinating anecdote and discuss arcane philosophy ,
that allen is not really a great film artist at all .
who is intent upon telling the same boring old story again and again .
the best part of this movie is the cinematography .
the visual side of 'presque rien ' is so amazing it deserves highest note .
that i just loved.- bizarre touch .
this may be my favorite .
this one has a real funky feel
i could have easily given the college girl murder a 7/10 .
the movie fails
are ridiculous ,
( which is laughable not only because they know his name ,
to get coverage of his bad movie )
zero day is a bad movie
i loved bruce broughton 's music score
the best aspect of the movie were the three animal ,
wherea fox has the funniest line ,
this is one beautiful-looking film ,
with beautiful close up shot of canada ,
there is never a seriously dull moment ,
with a 9/10 from me .
that this cartoon seemed like a place holder in between the really great cartoon
not the greatest cartoon ,
this movie is most possibly the worst movie i have ever see in my entire life !
and the whole `` little man '' crap is just so stupid .
this is just a pointless horrible piece
the joke are not funny
fever pitch is a fun enough movie .
it has a lot of funny moment
than that it continues to be funny until the end.even
too.7/10.barky
great leslie cheung as ling choi sin
where he meets and falls for a beautiful woman
a chinese ghost story opened my eye to the incredible world of asian fantasy horror
a magical realm inhabited by beautiful female ghost
with superb direction from siu-tung ching
excellent editing from david wu
a chinese ghost story is a completely unforgettable and thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish .
this is surely one of the worst film
the ridiculous story line
poor joan bennett ; she is the only one in the movie
actually it is not a bad flick by fangoria film ;
`` servered ty '' simply lacks it own distinctive style .
but it can get melodramatic and a bit in dry in the fun factor .
as the couple you loved to hate .
the past footage of their twenty-some-odd year together really ings their final moment home.if this movie does not make you feel the pain and agony of these two fascinating person ,
drew barrymore was excellent in this film .
it is an amazing interpretaion of an oft-filmed/performed piece .
the pan and scan really kills this film 's wonderful cinematography and set ) .
just great storytelling the way
jacobi is especially perfect as hamlet 's murderous uncle :
and his beautiful wife morgan
that seems to be the worst of it ,
and committing a terrible deed
this is a solid film noir with excellent performance and all the shadowy photography and murky morality
the classic noir
this movie would be more enjoyable
it is one of my all-time favorite movie .
the scene at the airport with the ief shower and beautiful music was sheer poetry .
its subtle in its approach
politically speaking.the movie also contains some really great one-liner such as ( a personal weakness of mine ) :
a great movie
with a backdrop hinting at greater depth
this movie is terrible .
is a great film .
remember those gem !
to get th bad taste out of my mouth .
the perfect son is a wonderful movie
the ending was absolutely horrible .
their performance were excellent !
robert duvall 's and jame earl jone ' performance are completely wasted on a god awful storyline ... or lack thereof .
that i had just wasted 2 hour of my life
the acting performance by the entire cast were excellent ,
but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movie ...
not excellent ,
and who can blame her ?
and instead of being insulted by that ,
while he is insulting her very badly .
this movie is an insult to woman kind .
but the bad vibes
it is reasonably funny by bit ,
it got great star
are forgettable ,
is amazing ,
it is terrible
that actually have a story and excellent music
and they have many other thing that they need to do with their life ... the idea about having a very young band is horrible ... they need to stop having band like this ... and i do not like the idea at all
nor the kid themselves ... they are very annoying
that this is a very boring comment thing ,
i would have rated the series a perfect 10 for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of season 10 !
if this is just a horrible movie or the worse movie i ever saw .
this movie would make an excellent double-bill with session 9.i
i was kind of disappointed about this two guy ,
has a really bad script ,
only and i did not disappointed again .
still great photography
logical and beautiful ,
about this film is i get a bad dvd .
but also rather funny in a low-ow way.this
is another of the fun episode of the twilight zone .
and was kind of funny at the same time .
this film is no `` guilty '' pleasure.three wonderful sophisticated leads actor - urbane melvyn douglas ; bemused cary grant ;
let me begin by expressing my admiration for a perfect portrayal by reese witherspoon .
that her performance stands out in the excellent cast is praise indeed .
robert mulligan has seldom disappointed those of us
making at its best .
i tried as hard as i could to sit all the way through this irritating mess ,
as the lead and all the supporting cast were only marginally worse .
from the awful acting to the laughable fx to the stupid plot.complete waste of time ;
root canal therapy would be more enjoyable .
watching a uwe boll movie would be only a little worse than this .
it is so boring i felt
i like bad movie 's
but it was just boring .
some funny bit ,
this film is very confusing and inconsistent.bill 's a funny guy ...
the borderline between comedy and preaching can be annoying .
is non-sense.i had great trouble
that simplifies all religion as the same is simply disappointing .
technique are demeaning and insulting
before in `` basic instinct '' .it is really a wonderful thriller i enjoyed very much.so
10/10 .
this movie is incredibly bad .
surreal film noir released soon after the `` real
`` sasquatch hunter '' actually was not as bad as i thought .
this was not as bad
and actually gave me a little jump on first viewing.the bad news :
which made him look totally ridiculous and destroys any credibility
but it is still not the best sasquatch movie ever .
it is actually quoit enjoyable .
( gellar especially is disappointing
in it and made thing more confusing and/or dull
amazing effect for a movie of this time .
its manner is one of wistful profundity
while this is an excellent and challenging film ,
it is not an enjoyable one and its difficult to think of any time
that lanza did a superb job in the story ,
reaching the high note of be my love is not easy ; but beautiful !
but we did and i feel obligated to warn other to avoid it at all cost .
and if that were not bad enough ,
have those horrible mole removed
they get worse every time .
acting or script is a waste of time and money .
0.02/10 .
as the single worst movie i have ever seen in its entirety .
alternating between a silly and contrived plot about an extremely annoying photographer ,
who know how to have fun ,
that shoot cheap wedding on camera ,
because it is just way too ridiculous.the script was _obviously_ written by someone with no writing experience whatsoever .
a similar common approach about child abuse with no original insight is very simple-minded and disappointing .
there are those bad guy
the actor did their best with what
how i miss this show so bad..
that i liked best about the show ,
it has to be its `` not predictable plot-line '' .
favorite actor was lucas black.. i adore
and enjoy a great show ,
both wonderful .
i am sure.everything about the original was so excellent
it is even annoying finding yourself comparing the two mentally
but william was not too bad in this movie .
unfortunately
this film is stunningly beautiful .
because you can see the art at its most beautiful
this movie is awful
and amazingly bad .
and what is even worse is that there is also a puppet with strand of felt hair
all the while a most annoying soundtrack play in the background like some kind of spiritual discovery
there are just varying degree of bad .
i was bored almost into a coma watching this stupid
mol shine as legendary pin-up queen bettie page in a fine biopic.gretchen mol is probably best known for being tauted as the next-it-girl a few year ago
is wisely not graphically depicted nor is the subtle showing of her own father
when she arrived.a beautiful raven haired sweetheart with a divine figure ,
and she is having fun in her increasingly less-clothed portrait -
mol is perfect
limit it.worse is the historical reality of the film .
just who is and who is not among the undead by the end of the film.the only negative is that i felt sorry for the poor snake
does it proves fascinating to watch unfold before us .
i particularly enjoyed the comic scene
does not stop the movie from being just plain good fun viewing though .
jj has always been my favorite and i love
and the indictment of it in most of these comment made it more fascinating to view .
but great is not anywhere to be found anywhere here - story
often boring detail such as seen on court tv and in real-life courtrooms.every character in this presentation was either insipid
obnoxious
boring
fascinating
movie would appear their best forte - probably best in 2nd-lead
an excellent film depicting the cross current in the life of a multi-ethnic mix of not so ordinary person in the rural pacific northwest .
solid directing and writing along with fine acting
( from my favorite television show deadwood )
the film is funny
features great acting
and beautiful photography .
this is destined to be a real indie gem .
it even has music by my favorite band the silver jews !
the only disappointment was that molly parker was not there at the screening .
even without her there ... this was hands down the best film i saw at the festival .
and really is insipid is the tedious work
with the dumbest member of the audience knowing
really one of the stupidest sequence ever put on film .
given the immense 'bad will ' generated by both this stupid
stupid movie
the best scene 's from the movie ; the museum scene and the elevator murder .
`` body double '' .brilliant nerve wrecking thriller .
i love de palma ! 10/10
this has got to go down as almost one of the worst movie of all time .
awful acting
awful script ...
were so predictable as to be pathetic .
it is potent.to call swept away awful
my back literally hurts from cringing so much at poorly delivered line .
is a wonderful satire and metaphor
superbly acted and written ,
they are great fun to watch ,
as this movie was terrible like he said
both of book are great read the book then watch the movie ,
who described charley chase as unfunny ,
the guy was not funny .
unfortunately
and the gag are so poor .
it is still an awful film .
jeroen krabb\u00e9 is i guess the poor man 's gerard depardieu ... ..naturally i hate gerard depardieu
he is box office poison and jeroen krabb\u00e9 is worse than that .
is it funny ?
because he is the worst actor and every character
it is the worst film ever
i knew 'patch adam ' was horrible
it is great fun to watch .
goldie knew this was fun-fluff
i loved her in laugh-in and every thing
because his 4th one main prem ki diwani hoon was so bad .
as usual alok nath as the good and loving father is fantastic ,
a lawyer and his son william the future admiral of battlestar galactica.like battlestar galactica the series includes some great experienced actor in eric stoltz
while the racial theme rarely touched on in bg
at the prestigious amsterdam fantastic filmfestival
certainly one of the best film in troma 's liary
'mojo ' features a strong performance from ian hart and annoying one from aiden gillan and ewan bremner ,
rather dull
this `` soldier '' is best left forgotten .
i enjoyed the first 10 minute
it catches some of the landscape with such a beautiful light ,
in fact the cinematography is probably it is best asset.but
patrick mcgaw is great though and very easy on the eye
`` edtv '' and `` amistad '' and avoid too `` larger than life '' and `` angel in the outfield ''
if any line.as for scorpion springit is not a bad film
talented actor like jeffrey tambor and christine baranski are utterly wasted here .
this is a superbly put together cinematic piece !
some movie are so bad ,
this is really low budget bad quality bad
but what could have been interesting stay stupid
bad acted
but that definitely does not add any quality to the film.it is a waste of time
why not see a pseudo-film noir .
that the national picture are awful ,
a woman 's drama the has some unexpected funny part
there is also a predictable air to each of the chat tracks .
funny and intriguing in all part .
the character development is near perfect ,
obsessed with late 18th and 19th century dynastic tale of japan may snub this film as not kurosawa 's best work .
but even at his worst
kurosawa is better than many of the best .
this story is so based in elevating the mundane life of ordinary person in a time of great change ,
this is a worthless sequel to a great action movie .
cheap looking
and worst of all
boring action scene !
should avoid this one !
however this is sadly not the case here .
that there are no really great movie starring dog .
is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated.the film does have its moment of pseudo-kafkaesque surrealism
it fails to convince ,
i strongly recommend `` franz kafka 's it is a wonderful life ''
there are some superb actor in the film
with his typical no nonsense attitude and hardcase appearance.the other are not bad
the poor plot
you can say `` poor criminal . ''
`` poor us . `` p.s .
extremely enjoyable as some are ,
are up there with some of my favorite aspect in a movie .
that i thoroughly enjoyed watching
was possible the greatest piece of cinematic shooting
remains one of the best film in cinematic history .
to ight and beautiful ,
but the backstory is lame and disappointing .
ashton kutcher is flat but not terrible .
it could have been an excellent film - and costner need one !
worse there is not even enough nudity
but it simply is a dull boring film
not the type of thing you should be thinking about in a gripping thriller.avoid .
well flora robson was great .
to find a greater rodger and hart fan than me
in addition to which they knew der bingle inside out and tailored some great song -
but beautiful
gosha 's last great film of the 1960 's .
and becomes an assassination target.one of the best photographed film ever ,
many shot are incredible composition of form
but actually a very accurate depiction of a drunk.downbeat but one of the great chambara film .
and on the second time i did get a great laugh at the movie 's expense .
clean fun . ''
the second time can be quite funny
because it was so poorly done .
to see what may truly be the worst movie ever made .
is a dreadfully under-written woman-in-peril film
from the weak dialog and bad acting to the jaw-dropping lapse of logic ,
the house is a mess with toy .
sure the film is stupid .
i loved the ending !
it is an excellent film
tedious girls-at-reform-school flick ,
it was hard to force myself to watch the movie to the bitter and in my opinion somehow unconsciously funny end .
why is this movie so incredibly boring ?
he gave an excellent performance ,
the result is pathetic
was asking stupid question ,
that would be the dumbest thing
this movie was so bad .
it is rare that i hate a movie this much .
that might not have been so bad ,
so horrible wrong as well .
that i was watching a bad movie
so it got watched.bad mistake.the shot i spoke of in the the summary up top is in the trailer and on the poster .
something more substantive than a motley bunch of badly-realised fable from what is just a standard eastern mystic ideology dressed up as a `` cool
badly edited { pace all over the shop
me '' motif/ message ,
a genuine waste of my time.as for the undoubted ability of some person
i am glad you enjoyed it .
great art is because they do not understand the 'craft /material /moon cycle /filament of supreme rational thought '
`` the greatest trick he ever pulled
if you want to see great acting .
great unheard of movie.it was done
and she is just wonderful .
as always is a great presence
and just his eathing has great feeling .
it really was quite boring
as the worst movie i ever managed to sit through .
fire their obnoxiously noisy sub-machine gun with wild abandon ,
just follow the shell casing and smoke ! painfully bad dialog
the plot is ridiculous ,
save yourself - avoid watching at all cost !
this movie was predictable and pretty boring .
i have not seen a more pathetic attempt
was lame ,
for the most part the acting was lame ,
this movie was lame.oh and pray for the guy
he looks really bad .
the best actor in this movie was probably the guy in office space ,
and he was only in this movie for about 8 minutes.4/10
or magazine grading ... .martha plimpton is amazing
an awful film !
so why did they come up with this dishwater-dull script ?
but the best about the movie is it
it is rare to get scared by performance
but it is in fact the greatest parody of the horror genre
bad
stupid
one of the best of these is the very presence of ed mcmahon in a starring role as a john birch-style right-wing crackpot .
that was actually funny .
burn won the best supporting actor oscar for this ,
matthau was nominated for best actor
and there is not a false note in this beautifully timed performance .
that `` my name is julia ross '' in this 1945 film noir
she became one of the great acting teacher in los angele .
`` descent '' is so poorly made in term of picture and sound quality
not message
-- - a message that ,
unfortunately
but the sequence is just too damn long and pointless .
this is an excellent 8 minute plus outtake
as she delightfully vivisects poor francie swift 's prissy
unbelievably bad acting
2/10 .
it is boring.when the movie kicks into action
everything is predictable and cliche .
it looked more like a 2 parter in a bad sci-fi tv series .
just a lot of predictable dramatic conflict between the main characters.do not waste your time .
how bad it was .
i was shocked at how bad it was .
is ultra bad .
the set and prop are so ridiculously fake ,
that my countryman produced such a horrifyingly bad film .
and the same power structures.totally amazing !
or the counterweight illusion ... 8/10
it really was a waste of my life .
these person get `` terrorized '' by this pathetic `` crazed killer '' ,
it had a perfect balance of all five aspect .
the action was fun and exiting .
and still i was captivated by the fantastic drama ,
the cast was amazing !
michelle pfeiffer was wonderfully wicked ,
even the newbie actor played their roll to perfection .
fun even the mush had good dialogue.score - i give this component 7 point .
excellent movie for everyone !
add to the mess the fact
that the direction is dull
not bad as such
but badly made and dull .
but the film is a constant and perfect illustration
it is all the less fun
and going to the funeral of a stranger for no apparent reason .
why did i waste my time with this movie ?
there was not a single funny joke or line throughout .
the slapstick was not even mildly funny .
that film was very funny )
.avoid like the plague !
eddie murphy looks just ridiculous .
is extremely beautiful and a perfect delight
some bad guy are after them ,
( sagemiller )
the bad guy are just bad guy ;
who the hell needs bad guy ? 3/10 .
which also comes with an excellent commentary track
this film is beautifully photographed with an excellent soundtrack .
the acting was pretty bad ,
provided some beautiful east ,
the soundtrack of the album is one of the best prince
sometimes over-the-top fun .
they counterbalance the somewhat bland lead .
neither bacall nor hudson could ever be called bad actor ,
in a laughable attempt at a surprise
this is not a bad transfer .
it is not a bad transfer.rather ,
it is a bad film .
if you like bad movie with bad acting watch this .
disappointed .
and some interesting photography but as a whole this movie fails to convince .
and all in all the picture is an unconvincing mess.it is one of those film
classified as a film noir
i had wasted my time.4/10 .
is bad enough
it would be bad enough
terrible dialogue and more plot hole than a golf course
and i like bad movie !
avoid like the plague .
it is not perfect ,
which looks quite amazing.there are not enough english horror film for me ,
and this one is not as bad
and unfunny bit of business such as janie 's little sister ibing family member
the movie was incredible
it is the best special-effect kung fu movie
it is quite poor both as an early talkie and as an attempt at a musical -
the film is very badly written
stock full of stale and unfunny joke and stupid situation .
to me this is a sign of bad direction through and through .
the plot itself was not that bad .
cuba gooding jr. however was terrible .
the action scene were not bad ,
the only redeeming factor is angie harmon .
too bad the director left her hanging .
do not waste your time with this one .
avoid !
or otherwise just boring or predictable .
who found her annoying on occasion ) ,
( if sam and gray were such great dancer ,
greedy and stupid ,
and what is even more boring ?
which is also fairly boring sometimes ,
and the dumbest thing are usually done
not the best abc family film
i would not want to waste my money on this garbage by renting it .
since his fantastic work and magnum opus 'underground '
as we observe a funeral mass and wedding on a one-way dirt road .
are about to collide with the funeral mourner
they meet a motley assortment of extremely lame monster ,
and mccallum has an affair with the queen of phoenicia.it is so ridiculous ,
( tested poorly they say ) ,
by no means is the a great film ,
mine loved it
this movie was really great for my sensitive little girl
this film is great as a bedtime movie for happy dream instead of nightmare .
i would just say this technically excellent
flawlessly acted and uplifting little flic will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a half 's entertainment :
without becoming clich\u00e9d or predictable in any way .
how awful this film was .
is really hard to believe.avoid ...
well executed.. a illiant film with a fantastic aesthetic and atmosphere .
the third is an insult to the series
1. it is that bad.oh ,
staging of action was terrible- person appearing from nowhere regularly ,
set were terrible ,
so bad !
it saddens me to rate a movie with a lot of my favorite actor
and had some great city shot
and i wish i could blame it on yet another bland performance from basinger
she is one of the worst actor in hollywood ,
and definitely the only bad actor in the film ,
and never closed and too predictable 'the sentinel ' is .
was it terrible ?
( very funny part of the movie ,
this is a very funny and unique film
i rate this 8/10 .
unfortunately this is not it.it should have been a good movie about wwi .
but the writing and directing are badly lacking ,
even though there have been plenty of bad general ,
but the silliest scene was the attack of the german flamethrower .
in this scene the german flamethrower operator walked in a oad line towards
but it is still disappointing .
are so badly written
the single redeeming quality of the movie was to treat it as a glimpse into the messed up life of a few loser -
and that is hardly stimulating even as an afternoon waste .
one of my all-time favorite so-laughably-lousy-that-it is-totally-lovable el cheapo and stinko nickel'n'dime independent horror creature feature
that the hick hamlet makes its cash off of.director/co-screenwriter william r. stromberg displays a wonderfully woeful and thoroughly clueless incompetence
cardella is way too bland and wooden
to cut it as a solid heroic lead
seem like pathetically unbecoming nobody bore in comparison .
a perfect set-up
but the plot i heard was so great ,
was so predictable .
boring .
the best part of the movie was the scenery
excellent .
the worst part was the slow moving interaction of the actor
the actor worked very hard at least trying to be a little believable with a terrible script .
try to avoid this movie .
best show since seinfeld .
she is really really funny .
it is all so funny or so stupid
it is just a lot of fun .
the show weak point are her sister and the cop-only
director with great talent
a thief in the night is an excellent fictional account of the week leading up to the rapture and the week following
that pivotal event.i thoroughly enjoyed both the production value and the content value of this independent christian movie.the production value .
this film is perfectly acceptable .
the message of the movie is superb .
he presents the message of salvation
he develops the message of salvation in two important way :
and theology is also perfectly acceptable .
perfectly acceptable .
a very enjoyable
it has some beautiful scene ,
but i was very disappointed .
boring .
this reminded me soo much of michael winner 's crappy 'dirty weekend ' with it is awful english low budget feel.firstly i must say
and any number of inventive and increasingly utal italian spin offs.this was just pointless though .
funny and visually quite entertaining ending .
5.5/10 for this three-minute incognito.united state championship :
7/10wwe cruiserweight championship :
7.5/10santa comes into the ring ,
this was probably the best technical match of the night
and the participant did superbly indeed for what they could without a ladder 7.5/10.being an on-and-off wwe fan ,
overall armageddon was a highly enjoyable pay-per-view
8/10 .
fantastic actor
great flick .
i tried to watch this pile of festering waste
also because you were going to waste the cash anyway .
what worse is that she had to watch this $ % and @ thing twice !
and it is fascinating show .
is great choice .
avoid
or are amused by poorly made horror movie .
an awful film with only the music as a redeeming quality .
but as with so many other low-budget movie there is more fun ,
this sadly makes the film not only difficult to watch
it far more interesting and enjoyable
this is a remake of an excellent film
what an amazing way
the direction was poor ,
the acting was mediocre
she is in fantastic voice
in allowing streisand to simply stand on stage and sing some great song .
and an impassioned medley of three song form funny girl .
which instantly became on of the singer 's best-loved signature song.streisand performs her immortal ballad version of `` happy day are here again ''
the premise is not funny or engaging at all .
the interview are not funny or entertaining to begin with ,
maybe it will be funny .
it was like a horrible dreadful version of cartoon network 's `` robot chicken . ''
and that is for the greatness of john saxon .
my most favorite appearance by him are in nightmare on elm street 1,3 ,
( also the cheap $ 9.00 price tag )
this show started out with great mystery episode .
no great joke except for the one-liner we have all heard a million time
that it would be the gem i remembered
and the frequent voice-over were terrible .
this is one of my favorite along with the mariette hartley and robert lansing `` sandy ''
this is an awful film .
nestor can notillana gives a great performance as sylvio ,
snafu short were actually quite funny .
their victory most likely had very little to do with their great musical talent .
definitely assures greatly macae set piece and impressive make-up art ,
be very stupid or b )
they just look downright pathetic and misfit .
where mr. shankar and his party fails.music is completely pale and uneffective .
but was of no use to a bad casted movie
this flick is bad and i mean bad .
it is just plain stupid .
and yvonne de carlo star in this funny
funny movie .
the late fred gwynne is truly wonderful as herman munster
blames the two .
ruining all the fun .
my guess is that the producer did not want to cast the american in the physically weaker role of the female ,
only seen season 1 so far but this is just great ! !
the crusoe family and why is that so great ?
great set up
solid acting with a liberating acceptance
with good and bad side .
but lacks any real depth
but this seems forced.it is an ok film but instantly forgettable .
while not as bad
( i have seen much worse ) ,
this is still a very lame movie .
venantino venantini is great
( and great fun )
as the bad guy
as the rest of the cast deliver mostly terrible acting
unfortunately .
that could not be more boring.greydon clark
3/10 .
what a gem of a movie ,
why did i waste 1.5 hour of my life watching this ?
to have a refund for the time
controlled life to one of complete spinelessness and irresponsibility could never be this rapid.from a graduation celeation to the predictable ending tristan price
this film has no redeeming quality .
the first half of the film is rather reminiscent to the sadly underrated john frankenheimer gem `` second '' \u0096 starring rock hudson \u0096
there is also plenty of great action and suspense ,
most notably when morgan soberly experiences how the digisoft crew inspects the result of their ainwashing-technique during boring convention .
jeremy northam is perfectly cast
highly recommended to person
but in 1950 it was rare to throw ahab into the mix with cain and abel ,
really boring
and just a sort of shameless pointlessness .
this is any better or any worse than the other .
is neither very funny or revealing
the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional idge player
some of the scene are very funny .
some of the dress are really beautiful ,
cn began putting up some pretty mediocre show .
that either terrible remake
susan and mary 's early experiment.dexter 's laboratory was probably one of the best cartoon on television
it looks abolutely awful .
never ends satisfyingly.the writing range from mediocre to horrid
its horrible reference and joke about teen culture will dismantle little child 's interest in the show ,
crowe was particularly wonderful in his role of lachlan .
is also beautiful
and superb acting .
this is a wonderful film
this film is supposed to be funny ,
and it is boring
boring
boring .
that was supposed to be funny `` what ,
.we are deeply sorry for that cr @ p. 2/10
the new character were annoying
worst of all
if it were just a wonderful and tragic-comic tale
it were featuring some really fantastic performance
nolte is at his very best here
the juxtaposition of faces is great ) .
this gives an actor a great opportunity to play different or unique character
in order to avoid getting stereotyping .
amazingly
i rank the film a 10/10 .
it is enjoyable
if he disregards the voice of the whistler.this william castle directed entry has some great moment
unfortunately
and back again to a complex noir plot for the last 15 minute or so.this is a decent movie
then you should enjoy this excellent movie .
i have never seen such a beautiful blackandwhite photo and such a drastic change in the way
not awful ,
but not great
on a beautiful spring evening
the only `` full length motion picture '' of the church 's i had seen was `` legacy '' and `` my best two year '' ,
in it is powerful message !
it was the best movie ever .
the whole movie is great !
in the real story mark anthony was ashamed by the slave 's great valor
bad acting ,
instead it simply saved it from being as bad as usual ,
and karl malden has fun as the dense and sleazy executive
the ending is funny and nicely cynical .
he was more than a funny man
his stanley uckridge will always have a `` perfect '' scheme
and best of all
that perfect butler kegg
( reginald gardiner in a wonderful performance )
the fun house sequence ,
is wonderful ,
and looks at gardiner as though he is either stupid or mad ) .
to get married is wonderful too.the film supposedly failed at the box office
i basically found eden 's curve to be a very poorly constructed
his comment are beautifully irreverant and yet emminently practical
the production value was great like the costume
i can tell you just how bad this movie is .
what i can tell you is that everyone avoided the camera crew since
this is a bad movie !
they are the greatest show ever .
while several of them are indeed wonderful classic ,
that were mediocre and at least one that stank .
usually watch.while this is not the worst episode ever made nor is it among the very worst ,
it is poor by any reasonable standard .
without any doubt has directed the greatest movie and biggest box office hit of indian cinema.this movie falls short of all expectation as this movie stars two great actor mr. amitabh bachchan and akshay kumar
but where the movie loses big time is the storyline screenplay and cinematography.a talented actor like bhoomika chawla has been wasted in the movie as well as sushant singh.but every director
sure it is not a bad movie ,
it is not even funny .
that relies on unfunny sex joke and racism humor does not deserve the money
for making such a bad movie '' .
do not waste your time or money on this one .
was a poor choice .
it was a simple and eathtaking view of a beautiful idea .
10/10 definitely !
this show is bad
the story was great
and it was fun
to bad sandman never appear but i kinda like it !
best spidey show ever ! !
my favorite episode are :
that was really really bad like :
he was terrible !
his last appearance was so terrible .
everything than this was bad !
since the premise was perfect for a prequel .
even if i had expected it to be bad i
to find a real gem ,
as an employee of the swedish air force i enjoyed the nice gripen and hkp 9
one of the few disappointment was the ews 39 jammer pod
his reading of `` high flight '' is superb.cheer ,
the one redeeming factor
who 's the only semi-likable character in this whole mess .
do not waste your money
is so obviously ridiculous .
a pentagon science team seem to have perfected a serum
well tradition.this is a gleefully horrible invisible man story ,
where the scientist work is just wonderful )
the film also has a great soundtrack by jerry goldsmith and classic horror-movie photography by jost vacano .
this is a great fun nasty movie .
the music is perfect ,
stupid
stupid
stupid .
talent is just wasted .
after we had already seen a not so great film
the entire audience really enjoyed it.personally i thought
and i loved the quirky cast of character .
it is a* 10/10 i promise once you watch it ,
after this awful movie finished for the first and last time on my computer screen .
than i am.this is by far the worst ano film of the lot .
it does not seem too bad at the beginning
but then we hit rock bottom right at the beginning with bad acting and a jumbled sequence of event .
but this one is like a train-wreck in it is poor sequencing of event and awful plot setup .
like you are coming down with a terrible headache ,
so the directing totally fails .
that is why this movie gets a point.the storyline ... lame
lame
lame
lame .
that arm waving and stupid chuckling
badly .
it seems so pointless .
and a lot of the time you just want him to take his awful one-liner
seems annoying and very shallow ,
and this is obviously due to the horrible ,
horrible script this movie was fitted with .
lisa wilcox may be a great actor ,
mostly.the last 15 or 20 minute of freddy 's existence in this film are awful and embarrassing .
pathetic.of all the movie i could hate ,
which is for the best.i know
horrible ,
and one of the worst movie ever made .
not recommended to anyone ,
but in the world of bad camped-up musical
this is among the most poorly executed in the bunch .
but it fails most apparently in the look and feel ,
the mid 1930 's when her youth and glamor held the greatest promise .
this a superb self-contained work
and loved the creepy movie
`` bad ronald ''
the acting is pretty lame
i found this movie boring
following these character through a weekend of awful event ,
unfriendly attitude and bad news just is not my idea of a watchable ,
the whole movie just seemed pointless and wandering ,
i was disappointed ,
especially after two local reviewer put it on their `` year 's 10 best '' list .
they just did an awful job in this movie .
it was not completely awful ,
the ending was especially disappointing .
it was an extremely disappointing end
who rather harshly blame marty ,
even though it seems to have a pretty bad reputation .
sure the predictable plot and lack of story will probably put many off
then you could do a lot worse than this .
to aidge the most fundamental of its ' citizen right
which looks nice.the bad point :
the terrible script
that would insult most child
what a well-crafted little gem this is !
and jeremy northam is the perfect mr knightley -
and the rest of the cast is no disappointment
and ewan mcgregor is convincingly charming - and alan cumming and juliet stevenson are the perfect `` impossible '' couple !
and the beautiful soundtrack contribute a lot to the feelgood
and there is plenty of fun - and some pretty cool editing -
- some beautiful acting and directing here ,
and the concluding dance summarizes the relationship between emma and mr knightley just beautifully .
my favorite jane austen adaptation so far -
this movie is an insult to all submariner .
it was stupid .
this movie was awful .
it looked like a wonderfully delightful historical piece .
choppy in almost every spot and dreadful in all spot .
was depressing at best .
too bad he had such a bad script
rachael stirling gives her best effort as the almost gullible lady in waiting .
i really wish blockbuster video gave refund .
you can skip past the boring or awful scene .
and is accidentally killed by his own beloved plant
but it avoids being totally manipulative for its simplicity .
including some real dud such as the unfunny cold war satire the day
strongly recommended for fan of international cinema .
and one that is filled with the great element of romance
the acting of clara lago is simply amazing for someone so young ,
the plot is unpredictable
perhaps the best feature of this film
this dreadful event should be used
2001 '' victim.the best thing
it one of the worst film i have ever seen .
it was full of all the awful comedy
and enjoyed some of the situation ,
in that the second film made is the best
that this film is not that bad and i can certainly think of worse hammer comedy .
it is barely watchable and unbelievably boring
certainly one of the worst film i have seen in a long
should be avoided at all cost .
because they are so badly made those person
therefore good.bad film-making is not `` different '' ,
it is just bad film-making .
that it is a very neat film with great song play and good imagination .
which has some of the best dancing
the character seemingly intentionally bland and one sided .
the ending was so weak ,
diane keaton was horridly unfunny as a middle-aged chain-smoking dog hoarder
and worst of all
boring.i suppose i should iefly mention the other character ,
their performance were so lackluster and dull
by the end of the movie i wanted to slap her myself.awful .
they are subtle
that is highly predictable .
the beginning of every scene is easily predictable in the way
and thus lacks any punch for the modern day enthusiast.a positive for the film is its lingering camera shot and dark lighting
it falls far short of a truly great horror/thriller film.i suggest
.all three film are populated with unsympathetic character
it is not too bad .
the film had many fundamental value of family and love .
( it was very easy to understand making it perfect for child )
and was enjoyable and humorous at time .
but harron avoid any kind of personal exploration of the character .
harron and turner have managed to avoid anything
could possibly put a bad light on their heroine ,
and have therefore avoided any in depth probing into
can we look at any other dictator and horrible governmant
it is done with rare emotional perfect-pitch .
witherspoon is excellent :
and consciously decided to make the best possible movie ,
was i wrong.end game has just about the most ridiculous plot i have ever had the displeasure of enduring .
accompany this with a laughable script and seriously flawed
the special effect were worse
and the acting of the rest of the cast was even worse .
as to how bad the acting was a child
gave the second best performance in my opinion .
the imagination of a child is fascinating ,
and that is where a great story begin .
`` intensive care '' by dorna von rouveroy is easily one of the worst horror movie
ever made.this extremely cheap dutch slasher flick offers some gore and plenty of absurd situations.a horror veteran george kennedy is completely wasted
and the dialog are painfully stupid.still
what a horrible
horrible film .
it is just a reflection of the worst of the worst in reality tv .
are the most obnoxious part ,
yes some part are lame and exceptionally convenient ,
although a bit inspired by hollywood oldie like `` the great escape '' and `` bridge on the river kwai '' .
they are stupid ...
but they are still pretty fun in a `` so bad ,
i enjoyed this movie .
dean cain was excellent in the role of bob .
dean cain 's performance was an usual excellent .
but this is possibly worse than both title .
only worse in some scene .
like cruella were mediocre .
a hugely disappointing sequel to the most memorable of the 60s disney movie along with jungle book .
i can only give this a 3/10 ,
and the same story becomes just a boring ,
unfortunately in this dimansion gone ... is a flashy
she and cage are supposed to be old flame ,
characterisation is so poor
`` this is not the worst film in the world
and in many way i enjoyed it .
it is just that it is predictable
that never fails to live up to its reputation as a horror masterpiece !
halloween is a fine example of a perfect horror film !
the cast is excellent .
the great donald pleasant does a perfect performance as a myer 's doctor ,
that never fails to thrill and chill .
the scene is beautiful ,
as truly beautiful geisha would not be the over westernised pumpkin in the movie .
the actress are great .
gong li is great ,
but it would be an insult for the movie itself and for art alike
if the movie wins the oscar for best costume
best director or best picture .
and thrown together blood scene were extremely over cg and some of the mutant were ridiculously gay looking
it also sucked because the acting was just plain horrible u think
just because how stupid and lame they acted
it was not ridiculously bad ,
but i am really disappointed with it .
out of nowhere it takes a turn towards a bad episode of the twilight zone ,
that was not as good ... a bad episode of the outer limits.my main complaint about the movie is
the end is also pretty easy to spot.the cinematography was poorly done
but there was the occasional ridiculously bad
south africa is in the grip of the terrible apartheid ,
and i was disappointed with that as i was expecting to see him for the entire movie .
but he was amazing as steve biko ,
and captured his personality from what i have read really well and his accent sounded perfect .
his performance earned him an oscar nomination for best supporting actor .
kevin kline deliver a excellent and thought-evoking performance as donald wood ,
and penelope wilton is excellent
it is also a searing and devastating portrayal of a beautiful land divided and in the hellish grip of racial segregation and violence .
is wasted as a madam
are awful.with `` nada '' this a second period of barren inspiration for chaol .it would be `` violette nozi\u00e8re ''
beautiful english country and seaside or not.the number
to have great conflict among the cast ,
and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and low-cost heartstring element .
fun little film
without it coming off as too cheesy or ridiculous ,
that more enjoyable .
had \u0091the dentist ' not been intended to be a fun ,
sadly
but is certainly enjoyable ,
clone from the late ninety may very well find this a refreshing change ,
a seldom dull and generally well paced script as well as some proficient direction helps
far from perfect but far from bad as well
sadly .
she resembles a deranged renee zellweger with a bad hair-do .
the music is terrible .
using a different name.best line in the film from tony -
a 4/10 .
baseketball is indeed a really funny movie .
surprisingly good actually ,
is a really good and funny film ,
7.5/10 .
when the show does not resort to the painfully bad 'fighting'-scene ,
he could have turned out worse .
unfortunately
unfortunately
and is executed in such an unpredictable and refreshing way
who avoids multiplex like a rabid dog .
by it is worst moment .
jason lee is performing some wonderfully subtle comedy in this movie
better movie to watch but definitely not the worst pick ... cheer
excellent film showing the pathetic life of two nutty old lady .
writer/director/co-star adam jone is headed for great thing .
rarely does an independent film leave me feeling as good as his did .
you will not be disappointed .
so badly
and many are extraordinarily beautiful .
or even somewhat integral to the script.poor tilda swinton is wasted .
is the least interesting portion of this fascinating fantasy.david niven and kim hunter are wonderfully cast as the young lover ,
it is a supreme example of what a wonderful year 1946 was for film .
is excellent and the way
it shifts into bandw for the heavenly sequence is done with great imagination
an annoying experience .
to the whole mess .
gretta sacchi was terrible !
this movie had terrible acting
i loved the token black coach ;
that it was bad acting ,
bad filming
bad writing and in short poor
this is only somewhat attractive for fan of `` bad movie '' entertainmant .
the plot is quite awful though .
yet imaginative mess .
and alex winter return as the two punk-rock idiot in this sequel to the time-trotting adventure comedy bill and ted 's excellent adventure
that happens to include the duo 's worst memory ,
bill and ted 's bogus journey is fun
to waste $ 7 on this movie ... weak
acting weak story weak script .
how weak the acting is ?
i loved steve carrell in anchorman
so i was expecting great thing .
i was disappointed is the understatement of the year .
ridiculous set-scene
and do not like to waste money .
avoid this like the plague .
( when that poor goat 'accidently ' fall off the cliff ,
it is considered a great film .
i would have given this movie a 1/10
and ... end.i really avoid watching pinoy horror movie
if it was not for the quite predictable and hollywood-ish scenario .
it is never a bad thing to search and explore old movie
but added a lot of fun to the story .
al pacino was funny and prodigy to himself .
and many thank to make-ups.to me it is not bad at all .
great fun .
the joke became funny
and they stayed funny throughout the movie .
i would give it an 8/10 .
( 10/10 after a few beer )
this movie is not as bad
it was enjoyable
funny and i love
i enjoyed it .
go watch the 50 best horror movie listed on this website .
and what better cause for revenge than the kidnapping of an innocent little girl.the writer did an excellent job in this movie
his death was noble in fact.denzel does an excellent job
great drama with all the area covered except for screenlay
some useless minute could have made more room for more heartpounding scene like those.the dragging of the film kept this one from all time greatness
i enjoyed this movie ,
and his best friend.this is the kind of film
but what i got was a real sucking stupidity .
all in all it corrupts all the great thing
and then the writer tried to make a movie leading up to it.unhinged is ultimately a boring film with bad acting
of how bad this movie is during the opening credit when
do not waste your time .
that it is great to see wesley jonathan back on the screen
because i really loved him in city guy .
'1408 ' is the latest hodge podge of cheap scare tactic .
it would make the perfect closing chapter to his latest book .
if what followed was a lot more than cheap `` boos ''
even that fails to quell our doubt
to make the movie a little less than completely forgettable.despite grand performance
i had love this wonderful film
my favorite song from the movie is `` candy heart and paper flower ''
but this movie was fascinating and creepy .
creative movie kept simple and focused with great acting by all .
this was not the greatest baseball movie -
it had a predictable ending ,
that he is part of this great family.one of the message
delivered by this wonderful film
you will be deeply moved by this autobiographical gem .
when will they learn you can not cloud the mind of great fictional detective ?
with making particularly bad film .
is perfectly cast :
the film is wonderfully directed by lewis milestone
there are wonderful touch
i understandably started watching it with a great deal of doubt in my mind
this is one of the best film
that it is not that funny
in one of the best scene of the film
who gives a fantastic performance as the lead
but gives a great performance none the less .
it is fantastic ,
some damn fool starts messing with the book ,
you are missing out on one of the greatest film made .
silverman rejecting pitch for `` funniest home videos '' and `` american idol '' and spelling promising his baby girl tori someday
and how he `` comes up '' with the `` idea '' for ca was is laughable !
by setting farrah up as the `` bad girl ''
it fails
and that is especially bad
that come from the original.it is not that grease 2 is bad ,
but i felt a bit disappointed by it .
the screenplay for this one is really weak and ings the whole film down .
made so it compensates for the weak scripting .
`` panic in the street '' is disappointing
( 7/10 )
bug rank top ten on my list of favorite ,
this `` moving '' movie should become one of your favorite also-
since then i must 've watched it at least three times.this is a wonderful
as well as all of the other clich\u00e9s.it is refreshing to see a movie
and he is so underrated.but this movie has excellent performance from everyone concerned ,
and kudos to the writers.a gem in the movie is near the end
and pretty bad .
as it is advertised as all three go through disappointment
had a pretty bad experience at southern california .
are disappointing .
how utterly awful this movie is .
as bad
ozzy does have a funny cameo as a reverend
it is funny seeing ozzy with short hair .
it is a cheap shot
as there would be one predictable situation after another .
but altogether the film is not at all bad and definitely worth
( 7/10 )
is a lame movie .
the situation were inane at best .
i am an avid watcher of bad cinema .
that make the movie enjoyable
.i have to not recommend this waste of disk .
this film is fantastic .
you can love for all their good and bad .
its the best thing he is ever done .
he was funny ,
it was very funny
`` i am going to take a shower '' .the plot is completely predictable .
there is no great acting ,
do not waste your money on this one .
he is going to pull the gut out his bunghole '' '' brilliant ! ''
nobody writes that stupid !
got ta be a spoof.i loved the part
that after the freaky guy had bested martial art expert porn queen and a couple out door type jock
when it was going to end.the death of john howard was completely predictable .
for giving this film a whopping 3/10 .
and the main bad guy is a gal !
no great actor ,
so badly and contributing to the continued growing ignorance of mass tv audience throughout the us.typical hollywood
very disappointing and a complete waste of time .
such a pretentious and lame attempt to hipness .
really the worse movie i have ever seen
however the movie was that bad
that i really could not feel like that sympathetic with them .
and their son started off his acting career with this truly awful attempt at 'tarantinism
this is a movie with no redeeming features whatsoever !
involved in this sorry mess of a movie .
the acting is so bad
the soundtrack features some very fun garage-punk tune and the raspy
although leste was considered perfect for the title role ,
i expect a lot of walking and bad script .
unfortunately
to not get boring .
but this one as to be amongst the best ...
it was rather enjoyable.naturally i was very interested in seeing the film version .
which made it funny or charming or interesting.the original
it was fun .
if it had seriously had a great plot or went crazy enough
it might have been enjoyable.as it exists
let the tape roll and edit in all the pointless dreck within eyesight .
and has this thing about seeing even the worse merde through to the end .
avoid this film !
it is so badly written ,
while that might make this campy and fun ,
it does not because everything is so lifeless the film becomes dull .
this movie could go in the enyclopedia as the standard-issue bad lifetime tv movie .
carrey was perfect as the out of sort anchorman wannabe ,
my favorite scene was
this comedy will go down as one of this funnyman 's best .
do not even waste your time ,
the acting was awful ,
the plot was weak ,
unfortunately ,
that are overcome through amazing writing .
craft wonderfully honet character ,
this may not be perfect from a technical standpoint ,
one word boring.the young demi looks good ,
a pale shadow of a great musical
than seeing this poorly-conceived film .
the perfectly stupid weapon .
was intented to mock jeff doing his form to dance music at the beginning of this stupid movie .
the plot is predictable ,
and she loved it just as much ,
it is the greatest love story ever told !
this is a bad one .
a good director would have had me mark this one as one of the great coming-out movie and not one of the miss .
all the actor give full blooded performance with conviction and realism.one message from the movie is the importance
10/10 .
this movie is great entertainment to watch with the wife or girlfriend .
a great excuse
says more to me about what an incredible movie this is than a whole book on its beautiful eye candy .
it is beautiful ( every blade of grass
funny
exactly what is going on mean subtlety
and assuming the audience is stupid ,
had what you thought was a great idea backfire ,
and your loved one ,
if you loved toy story
( the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable ) ;
it is amazing
it is by far the number 1 worst movie i
and he fails with some .
this movie was so terrible
even with the terrible sound quality
poor cinematography
was enjoyable to watch
and could have been funny
without terrible singing and cheezy piano music .
because it is awful !
( with excellent actor ) .
made me feel bad .
very outdated film with awful
clich\u00e9-ridden and mawkish dialog and a very poor construction .
the sound is horrible .
no subtle psychology
very cheap
simply because most of it is either ridiculous or boring .
it is bad
avoid it !
and what an amazing movie this one is .
the judge made the arrangement for the hit-man ,
i loved this movie ,
and the police at time are just as bad or worse as the hit-man .
not even with the very very incredible ending .
great movie
highly recommended .
it was a funny
this film is probably the worst film
it 1/10
it probably does not merit such a poor rating .
the serious illness of the daughter - to the frankly ridiculous - toilet continually flushing
and the film 's reputation as one of the director 's best - succubus is unfortunately is a truly awful film .
the longer european version is just as boring .
and it is all really boring .
and the sex is dull ,
and most of the runtime is taken up by boring dialogue
this would be a watchable hollywood mediocre
but with shining appearance of the detective who is the best actor in the film
as usual a solid presence amid the mania
has a director come off so annoyingly
some a little amusing and some just totally stupid ,
it is fascinating to watch how bad this all goes ,
and it is really funny.jim carry play bruce nolan ,
this drive is what is slowly driving his beautiful girlfriend grace
carrey 's pitch-perfect acting stay in character
like a it is a wonderful life wannabe.jennifer aniston is great and ,
if you are a fan of boring
pecker is actually a funny film
comes in with another great performance as pecker 's girlfriend .
it enjoyable.there are many funny scene ,
and provides the only entertainment in this otherwise dull and derivative zombie flick .
( and i have seen some really bad dubbing in my life ,
it is just that funny.but ...
then avoid this at all cost .
ending leaf us mourning the death of both the monster and one of our beloved hick
that i waste watching film like this ?
i found the latter stage somewhat disappointing \u0096
has the function
well i too had heard read all the eathless review and comment about how this movie might deserve the best picture oscar
what a major disappointment !
the man has some really great stuff !
earned by enduring 99 % stupidity .
it is an annoying series about annoying character in annoying situation ,
rounded out with annoying animation
but recognizing this and its other absurdist quality still fails to make dumbland worthwhile .
which is the best medicine !
left in a bad financial situation
brilliant !
we loved the scene
highly recommended .
except that it is plain awful.tina louise and adam west are the reason
but their talent are wasted in this junk.i think
is very annoying and over-acting by some of the actors.a rip-off of the wild one starring marlon brando
taking on bad ass vampire
now onto the bad ,
it is the dumbest most unbelievable thing
both joe don baker and bo svenson did a great job ,
they were only trying to let us know what a wonderful man the real buford pusser was and what a great family he had .
this amazing martial art fighter does not use any of her fighting skill
with some great cinematography and some cool fight scene ,
can you say `` horrible rip-off of samara
just bury the poor zombie and save some life
1/10 !
the result is arguably the worst film in scorsese 's filmography ,
the actor drawing scorsese 's camera inexorably toward him like a moth to a bulb.5/10 \u0096 even as a generic b-movie ,
gives the film its only great scene .
to show off her terrible acting .
she is undoubtedly a beautiful woman
do not waste your time on this movie ...
terrible film made on a budget of about $ 9.99 .
poor acting and an awful storyline concerning alien
not even on a `` so bad it is good '' level .
1/10
it was just cheap and childish
that the modern movie-watching public totally lacks discrimination ,
i have read on the message board of disclaimer
this fun and fabulous film has the look
and feel of the era with an excellent soundtrack
who really enjoyed having her photo taken
( she may just have the most perfect east ever ) ,
making a few poor film choice
you forgettable i
received one of the worst critical reaction
the superb ensemble cast
the sharp sardonic dialogue gives the actor great fun
widmark portrays the weak future ruler of france in a frenzied
it is perfectly restrained to emphasize the rational intellectual atmosphere for this film .
how the institution function
and as always he keeps thing unpredictable
this is one of his very best and most effective film .
wickedly funny
the blackest comedy i can recall.and very possibly the most wonderful thing
the movie is basically the story of a russian prostitute 's return to her home village for the funeral of a sister/friend .
an utterly beautiful film
conrad veidt played the baddie in two of the most incredible movie romance ever
john justin and june duprez were great in the leading role of lover
but rest assured this is a glorious feelgood experience with a 100 % positive message ,
this is a great example of a good
the killer tomato.the script is heavily but not obnoxiously aware
and mark price has a funny forum
mutated by toxic waste slug
the flick is fun somewhat through
and is of the 'so bad
( which is quite possibly the funnest bad movie
and it is government is bad
and music of the movie are all bad.most
and do not watch this stupid boring movie .disaster .
it is an atypical thriller with a decent script.8/10
it does not look good for poor eddie
written and directed by steve franke i will be perfectly frank myself
serum is awful ,
which tries to rip-off other any number of other 's and ends up being slightly more fun
the script is terrible ,
but it is so boring it is untrue ,
the first forty minute is nothing more than a really dull soap opera
and generally boring the audience stiff .
the dialogue is poor ,
it is dull ,
it is forgettable
did i mention serum was boring ?
to be sorely disappointed ,
either and just look cheap throughout .
it is dull
boring
and feel like a horrible soap opera for the first forty minute .
and it never got boring .
you will not be disappointed .
8/10 .
and utterly disappointed ...
unrealistic and rather annoying .
and your self respect do not waste your time with this pathetic attempt at a movie .
for just as the viewer begins to fall for the perfectly timed comedic element and wit of hartley 's illiant script ,
combined with the amazing performance of a perfectly
this film was totally ridiculous with a flying suit
i liked most of bryan adam ' song and the han zimmer score was excellent .
but as entertainment this was very poor and as a documentary style movie
it was worse.see for yourself ,
i was not disappointed at all .
it was great to see everyone back again ,
and there were a couple of really great scene here too .
an enjoyable movie
but i must have enjoyed it
but i do remember bonejack being funnier though .
and it is not really laugh-out-loud funny .
beautifully done .
the music is also amazing .
gackt and hyde do a wonderful job of acting ,
great acting in a fair film .
extremely predictable
by which one can properly judge salma hayek in the 1990s.the production value on the film was a bit poor ,
the governmant influence on the medium have only gotten worse ,
which to my great surprise appears to have garnered some actual critical praise .
the audience not simply to suspend belief but to render itself willfully ignorant to an insulting degree.i
but is nevertheless superbly shot and performed .
to perhaps a 6.5.as for nomination for afi best film ,
thomas ian griffin is great in this as the lead character `` max '' a dea agent diane is the fbi agent ,
this is the perfect crime caper ,
where you have some great shot ,
great photography and music in this film ,
( best actor )
presents the greater truth
that were a great help in understanding christy 's speech
the performance by daniel day-lewis is one of the greatest ,
a bad memory ,
nor was it funny after the turtle crawled out of frame.second
poor marketing i guess.if you see this at your movie rental store ,
because nothing is a great movie to watch .
which dealt with the topic in a greater than customary length
i have seen a lot worse .
( which i rate 10/10 across the board :
i was hugely disappointed .
blame it on the screen writing and directing .
its a true classic.xx maverick xx 10/10
this rated as one of the poorest movie i have seen -
and a poor one at that ... okay - a few criticism
and we see a flame-thrower
the acting is awful
that god-awful music
safe and/or dull
`` .independent does not mean that the camera work need to be horrible .
the composition was horrible .
strangely enough i watched little miss sunshine after this movie and the composition on that was superb - maybe
( who was funnier than the lead
( whose previous film was the excellent documentary lost in la mancha )
nor were the main character sympathetic .
a more unfavourable comparison would be the similarly disappointing velvet goldmine .
leon was fantastic as always
without neglecting to fill the show with lot of great music .
i felt a great joy ,
we can see here the best portuguese actore in this field .
it was fascinating .
who made the excellent performance as the autistic girl in `` the little devil '' by christophe ruggia
there is also a great cameo by ben vereen .
in what is probably his best performance to date .
gooding is great ,
the best actor in movie history
gives a towering performance- his best dramatic work in year .
charlize theron gives another solid performance as deniro 's much younger wife .
and a few of the character are just one dimansionally bad
a wonderful film .
made within month of each other.my second favorite kim novak film
coming in as third.all three performance are great
being the best ,
perfect for this bit of comedy.after vertigo
i enjoyed `` hot shot '' and `` the naked gun '' and their many sequel ,
was bad ...
so it was a great anticipation
but the print i got was extremely bad ,
'' from show boat.it starts with a few laugh and poor anthony in a one scene role
the movie has fantastic montage sequence
the worse it becomes .
that part was just stupid .
had only it gone on like that one scene i would have loved this film .
but the good guy are horrible .
since our beloved pope of the vatican is portrayed as an oaf .
mediocre in short .
tiffany shepis is absolutely wonderful
not to mention incredibly beautiful .
also richard elfman does a great job as sheriff and as the drunk boyfriend .
this is definitely one of my very top favorite .
7/10
and recall what made movie enjoyable once upon a time ?
it has enjoyed over the past five year
is ridiculous .
`` brilliant idea
the character are poorly written and acted .
the joke are so bad ,
is supposed to be funny .
the character in this arc were so annoying and overbearing
plus the great taste of maya angelou .
in it we see the abusive fianc\u00e9 get manhandled by his longtime victim and all around bad actress .
i really enjoyed the detail
this book-based movie is truly awful
and a big disappointment .
that movie is really awful .
it is also the best .
to be watched in the future.8.5/10
excellent episode movie ala pulp fiction .
8/10 music rating :
10/10
it is predictable and clich\u00e9d .
where `` my girl '' provoked a genuine feeling of sadness and some genuinely funny moment ,
and fails miserably .
because of how great the first one was ,
but quite honestly it insults the quality of the original with the sort of drivel this installment serves up .
as being one of the worst sequel of all time .
which i personally loved.i think
which makes this one even more beautiful !
excellent warner bro effort starring errol flynn in one of his best screen performance .
it is often cited as his best ,
a great screen presence
and also a great actor .
warm and funny script
walsh directs the ring scene beautifully ,
great final scene between ward bord and flynn .
and it is pretty much perfect entertainment .
one of the best musical ever made
beautifully acted and interesting from start to finish .
that are perfectly performed and orchestrated .
it certainly has more original and beautiful song than most musical ,
not bad for a director with no experience in this type of movie .
but what it lacks in modern sophistication
that i find truly funny .
the style is very sixties barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack by yello .
but fails painfully on all other front .
the plot is predictable ,
it is mediocre and silly in part
who played a minor baddie in the first one returns here
( the highly enjoyable `` magnum force '' )
that excellent movie was a relatively light-hearted suspenseful
the movie is plain bad .
simply awful .
the string of bad movie from bollywood has no end !
for making such awful movie
to deliver great performance ...
but they were directed so poorly .
the poor script did not help either.this movie has plenty of ridiculous moment and very bad editing in the first half .
person would stop messing about with classic
that the ralph fienne version is much worse
though as the casting of juliette ioche as kathy has got to be the worst casting decision
worse than the old quincy .
deepak verma does a great turn as hindley
and is in fact one of britain wasted talent .
the part of heath was played with great charm and belief and i think
son de mar is beautiful to see ,
in great anger
beautiful maiden singing seductively to far-off sailor ,
at least in my eye.watling is a beautiful and magnetic young actor ,
this film is great to look at .
good choice.i would forgotten how much i loved this movie
but still perfect as rochester .
the two lead play off each other beautifully .
this is the most perfect adaptation of the best romance novel ever .
sooraj badjatya ,
that badjatyas have left johar and chopra behind.there was not a single moment during the movie
shahid kapoor looks fat and shahrukhed ,
bad costume
cheap soundtracks.now the spoiler ,
this is possibly the worst of all the columbo movie .
andrew steven ' acting is poor as the villain ,
and the plot is weak .
would not just be a solid movie .
almost everything in this movie is great ,
the costume are really amazing
and the setting are also beautifully shot.the only thing
that she is a great actress
but he has great chemistry with emily blunt .
paul bettany is also solid as lord melbourne
but are forgettable.to me the film feel like unfinished .
it is a great movie about the early year of victoria with a great performance from emily blunt .
but is hammering its message in his head .
this movie is not funny .
the joke are horrible and unimaginative ,
( oh how funny ,
to find any of this stuff funny .
poorly done mockmuntary are so painful to watch ,
with lot of cool and funky image from all over jakarta .
and have searched for it ever since in my opinion although very raw it is very educational as to what the future can hold i enjoyed the movie and to this this day rate it very high sorry to all those
and in my opinion its great give it a go with all the cloning and test tube baby
and consider it a kind of a gem .
this movie has received a lot of bad press from person
`` house of the dead '' fails to be `` good bad .
hotd lacks any believability.worse still
there are frequent and numerous example of bad acting ,
leaving the movie with no redeeming quality .
avoid ...
he possesses.pure occult rubbish..stupid from the gate to the finish line .
it was so incredibly funny for everyone
it was so great ! liz
horrible camera work ... count the time
the dialog is ridiculous .
if you ever want to host a `` worst movie party '' ,
avoid at all cost .
she is not bad in this ,
that is as tedious as a dripping faucet ,
one of the most amazing show ever produced ,
the subtlety are truly out of this world
how bad this movie was .
the acting was horrid - not just bad ,
and almost every director draws forth outstanding performance from a cast of great and near-great actors.there were so many powerful portrayal in this film
that it is hard to pick one or two favorite .
so we can catch some of the subtle point
paris is photographed so beautifully
this is a badly made
sounds cheap and morbid
similarly the sex scene between saif and balan is quite unbecoming the movie and a cheap gimmick
`` hmmmmm ... that is so stupid ! ''
but that is what makes it funny .
and then find other really terrible .
and i have seen some pretty bad movie .
but it is absolutely horrible .
i have never seen a worse movie .
i am watching one of the greatest actor of the last thirty year .
the script was horrible ,
but pacino 's demotivated performance and obvious fake accent made it even worse .
donald sutherland 's role was laughable .
nobody speak much in this movie.one of the most laughable premise in the movie is how al pacino and kinski have this uncanny knack
funny to see you here again ,
`` bill and ted 's excellent adventure ''
everything else is perfect .
i never get tired of seeing deedee mess up his pizza line or joey mess up the name of the teacher over and over
one of the best part of the film is seeing
great film ,
who have some bad drug
that sell more of the bad drug to person .
this movie is pretty bad
are the worst movie
although he was subtle ,
highly recommended !
but no the less excellent .
great flick
has devolved into an abusive unfunny cretin
plus cosmo 's stupidity causes pain to everyone else
( my dvd copy is somewhat poor )
'' one of the lesser-celeated film of the great elia kazan .
and lets the trio sometime forget their ever-present goal and avoidance
pointless girl thing .
paint by number story and mediocre acting
that are really wonderful
the main family experiences.unfortunately this germ of a good movie is imprisoned in an aimless and extremely convoluted plot
every plot point is predictable
that one of the character is involved in a horrible crime
( in a totally predictable `` twist '' )
to take a big swipe at the establishment..to make fun of it and the hippie at the same time .
father knows best
when the hippie eat the weed is still one of the best segue in and out of sanity i have ever seen on film.if
thank to this fungal film i do not want my maypo ,
that it is fun to watch the way
finding the perfect gift ,
totally ridiculous .
like bad porn actor .
i can not think of a more useless waste of money
than this man shelling out for this pointless production .
their subtle performance are easily among the film 's highlight .
that pepper the movie like pointless pepper .
the 3rd worst movie of all time
( # 2 worst ) ,
they are all close and all terrible !
nothing of this movie is funny
do not waste your money .
is giving to your worst enemy .
it is that awful .
actually `` weed '' out the best
while the dysfunctional candidate stab each other until one is left
and that person is the best .
it is just amazing as one candidate audrey evan said
too bad for him
( the forever bland erika eleniak )
basically a decent rainy day movie.favorite line ,
its pretty bad
much beloved - indeed
when the original was loved and enjoyed by kid and adult alike !
when mother nature or technology went horrible wrong
many japanese attribute their fascination with humanoid robot to the old astroboy cartoon.but this movie was a poor re-image of the original .
there were funny sound effect
he caught it perfectly .
the film is hugely enjoyable with a great cast
and excellent direction by jame eve .
and everyone is perfectly cast .
the movie works at a great speed and the character take you on a terrific adventure ,
but what makes it work is that the film does not take itself too seriously with plenty of tongue in cheek action.great !
and so the great rewriting of history continues hollywood style.this was senseless ridiculous rubbish.it shock me
that such an amazing amount of money can be spent
poorly acted inaccurate film i have ever seen .
that leaving las vegas was a glitch in an otherwise litany of dreadful films.diane kruger proves
the wonderfully urbane ronald coleman is show-cased here as in few other of his film .
the movie is based on a french play and ings all the best quality of that farce .
and are absolutely perfect for this very funny film .
the fantastic mr. coleman is a combination of sean connery and clark gable
the best of the actor were the two lead \u0096 cole and catherine e. johnson as cassie
and the result is the best part of the film \u0096 subtle ,
( cole does his best work of the film )
and partly because i have enjoyed so many other film of this ilk .
this is one to avoid .
there are dozen of badly cut scene
the really badly animated clay toy are too painful to watch .
that are instantly forgettable.as many have commented ,
are shoddy this way unfortunately .
8/10 star .
that so much talent can be wasted in one movie !
and manages to build up some great expectation for the ending .
the movie turns into one of the worst story i
have ever wasted my time on .
the gingeread man is probably the worst grisham-movie ever
do not waste your time here !
so it gets 3. not for being so badly done
it is where he created his best works
it only gets *worse*
( who is rather perfectly cast ) .
and my sister and i loved it .
no bad language ,
just lot of great song and important lesson .
this movie really funny
direction is really the weakest link .
the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional idge player
some of the scene are very funny .
some of the dress are really beautiful ,
loved
utterly fails to ing anything to the role beyond a willingness
which consists primarily of a number of lovingly re-enacted bandd set-piece sandwiched between horrendously awful faux-biographical scene delineating ms. page 's fall from grace
that trades on the allure of one of the greatest pin-up of all time ,
no true bettie page fan will find it to be anything but a disappointment
i guarantee that.avoid at all cost .
that you will be sorry you wasted time with this one .
although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent ,
the performance were excellent ,
they enjoyed 1 1/2 hour of this is
word can not begin to describe how blandly terrible this movie is .
it were `` so bad it is good
it is just dull
and boring .
it is so bad i could not even laugh at it.in response to other poster ,
is he really that bad a director ?
everyone else has summed the story up perfectly -
this is a home movie best left
this clever script leads and dances the viewer between heaven and earth with the skill of a mountain goat and a present a charming ease rarely matched in cinema since .
bernard hepton was perfect as emmas father .
she is wonderful .
that when the uk does a jane austen its the best .
that is quite entertaining.the acting is pretty bad ,
the plot is predictable ,
very similar to the enveloping forest of jeff leiberman 's fantastic `` just before dawn '' .7/10.it is great to see daphne zuniga of `` the initiation '' fame run over few time by a car .
the show had great episode ,
it may not be the greatest movie of all time ,
is a single one of them bad ?
is a single one of them worth a score of 1/10 ?
it can not be bad .
10/10.p.s .
spiderman was a fun movie ,
i am a big fan of fan of film noir ,
and this film by otto preminger easily stands as one of the best
and preminger excellently balances several plot point ;
that the plot is given an excellent base
and the lead duo 's chemistry is excellent and tierney helps to complete every scene
but this film certainly fits into the film noir formula better than preminger 's earlier film .
highly recommended to all !
that gives you a bad gift ,
but trips up with a bad execution .
( predictable
sagemiller also deserves kudo for showing strength in the central performance ,
it is great the filmmaker try something different ,
but the film ends up a mixed bag and failed experiment.4/10
i could go on about how stupid this movie is forever though the one thing
is that it was ripped off from one of the best martial art movie of all time fistsof fury
the rest of the movie is absolutely ridiculous and a waste of tape .
very stupid slasher movie.we got your stereotypical teenager in a house thing going .
( that guy was my favorite part of the movie ) )
i swear this is the stupidest slasher movie
was just awful .
the writing was bad ,
acting was bad ,
special effect were bad .
i have watched several bad horror movie .
not matter how awful they may be .
stupid move )
to find awful movie
it is that bad .
horrible running gag
the main character are an annoying dinosaur klutz and whoopi goldberg .
and the audio quality is bad here and there
and really started to enjoy ourselves.it is very funny ,
if you appreciate great dialog .
are reunited with a lot of the great craftsman
one of the best dancer of 40s/50s cinema ,
why is the movie itself such a stupid bore ?
the premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing ,
if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talent of mgm is a tossed-off van johnson performance .
8/10 .
and superbly by laurence olivier.this documentary series defines the genre .
the best part of the series is listening to the veteran tell their story ;
it was done wonderfully ,
the cinematography is beautiful ,
the song selection was perfect
-- it only contained the song i actually wanted to hear and cut in with documentary footage during the weaker new song .
i loved
.the shot of the crowd were amazing
that lennon 's murder was horrible ,
but they are so undefined i did not realise.the funny accented guy with a ridiculous name
only for far longer and far far worse .
what happens to a toad ... '' line in x-man in level of utter bland baddness .
pathetic cliche and monica bellucci
that can not be bad .
so the chase is not bad .
it is never boring
it gets worse.the final climax to the movie is quite probably the worst imaginable .
to make it worse ,
was bad about the oracle and the foreign guy ?
the very worst thing about the original matrix was neo dying
by how stupid jar jar was they did not notice
how can the whole world have missed how utterly terrible
only so much worse i think
this film is just bad .
i really did not want it to be bad ,
bad in just so many way .
and to make matter worse ,
and that is what makes this so awful .
the worst film ever made ?
the most disappointing and defalting film ever made.undeniably .
not to mention kung-fu.it also possessed the greatest soundtrack in film history
this movie was awful .
it is funny
everyone in the movie did a horrible acting job .
it was some of the worst acting i have ever paid to see .
which was yet another disappointment .
it was stupid to show it in the first place
because they were just trying to make us feel worse for the vulnerable mother than the rest of the soldier ,
and it was even more stupid to keep trying to make us feel even worse for her
and is a bit too linear and predictable to be considered a classic .
the acting by a small cast is pretty good.and all through the house is not the best tale from the crypt
i found nancy drew quite enjoyable - featuring cameos from bruce willis and adam goldberg
because i thoroughly enjoyed the movie ,
as incredible
gojoe is an anime- and hong kong-inspired samurai action flick with a pacifistic message .
( a great acting job
for a film with such an anti-violent message gojoe wastes way too much energy and screen time
we are treated to some excellent footage of animal in their habitat
without feeling too bad about ourselves.the star of the show are a herd of elephant
to see them on the big screen.one of the disappointment i
was that otherwise terrific shot of great white shark taking seal were filmed in slow motion .
of slowing down the film to convey great quickness i
it is a solid film in its own right .
`` beirut ... he is the best damn baseball player
but it has a great time getting there .
the training scene are very funny
but the best scene may be the one
while attempting a make-up dinner with their wives.william and russell seem to have a lot of fun with this one
and it is too bad
is `` the great caruso '' in this 1951 film also starring ann blyth
and the music is glorious and beautifully
2007 comedy i enjoyed :
superbad
who enjoyed this
it would at least be funny .
but this was so awful ,
it was almost a perfect piece of edgy entertainment
i really enjoyed the reunion a lot !
which was worth the wasted 2 hour .
with two great actor michael caine and laurence olivier .
and it is a fantastic play.during
the photography was not bad ,
but the lightening was awful .
michael caine 's and jude law 's perform at their best .
the weakest part was the mid part .
is not awful ,
with no wasted time or pause for thing like `` thought '' or `` introspection '' .
but it is an ok time-waster .
it is a terrible shame
it has become so bad
that `` villa paranoia '' would be a terrible film under any circumstance .
of having wasted time and money .
i particularly enjoyed `` de frigjorte ''
as an actor he is usually funny ,
it is much worse
and bad camera work .
is no worse than several of the heralded actor in the cast.i give this a 2-out-of-10 rating .
( at worst ) .
i found this film to be an awful mix of `` real '' science and pseudoscientific
that has a predictable meaning to most person
that the master himself described so well in his superb essay `` politic and the english language . ''
what a mess .
where you can see the bad guy of the film .
because he is the best
funny ?
it is just too funny to tell )
that this movie is a waste of time.so do not watch it .
mary astor is refreshing as the put-upon niece
which is also fun .
and coming.the caf\u00e9 scene work best with the hand-held cam
i voted the episode awful
this is a great movie for all age .
the trek home is all beautiful with all the wonderful wildlife scene .
and are great actors/actress themselves .
everything about this movie is great !
10/10 the whole way !
i just wasted 83 minute of my life
watching the worst horror movie
the acting was just god awful
the dialog was worse ,
can not think of anything horrible enough to say .
this is the worst movie
and always found amazing the way
drama and great cinema in his movie .
great art .
of viewing this beautiful film last night ,
with the wonderful addition of a question and answer session with the director following the viewing .
talk to your loved one
so i will be nice.3/10
mean wow this has got to be one of the best story 's i
and speaking of loved one ,
and that just from the first few chapters/episode of the series.the story itself is amazing .
but when worst comes to worst
the worst pervert to ever live .
the worst dad ever from an anime ?
probably one of ranma 's greatest rival and my favorite character
but his worst fault ... is his lack of sense in direction !
10/10 !
it out.a total waste of time .
i left it with a strong feeling of wasted time
and of being thoroughly stuffed with `` killing whale is bad '' propaganda .
where `` good '' and `` bad '' are not deduced in the course of action
how surprising.2/10 .
this is perfect eak for him
as to make fun of the bond icon .
`` i am a mess
its great to see brosnan play a character
his first movie 'house of game ' was the one i liked best ,
is pathetic .
unfortunately
ending is particularly lame .
good actor wasted and the original television series has all but ruined here .
pathetic acting ,
happened on spetember 11th '' or `` a funny thing
one of my favorite and one of the cutest actor ever .
twisted desire is my second favorite movie .
this is a movie about joseph smith and a great one at that .
jeff view and opinion differ greatly from joseph smith and the ld church
jeff thumbs his nose at government and flee at all time.i loved this movie
what is important is our message
this was a really great show .
( the best in my opinion )
stars the wonderful peter cushing as philip grayson
than meets the eye.story three stars one of my very favorite ... christopher lee ,
from the psychedelic graphic of the introductory credit and the great score
jone was a perfect spirit .
more person will be able to see this rare gem of spirit history .
such as the great alain delon version of the 1970s
( although all copy i ever saw were badly edited ) .
shows the best and worst value of africa ,
the beautiful african-american wife of the english doctor david linderby
in an excellent scene with supernatural overtone ,
where the two man haggle is one of the best in the film.at the slave market ,
he set himself completed.the overall plot of the film is excellent
and it is great to see a 19 year old ben affleck
and won best actor at the venice festival in 2006.this movie can be appreciated by person of all age .
which makes it a perfect subject for a horror movie
in this one.5/10 .
this film was done in really poor taste .
the script was really bad .
as the great white savior of the world please tell me
how poorly this movie was done
this is one irresistible great cheerful- and technically greatly made movie !
the movie features some of the greatest looking
the entire set would obviously move.the best moment of the movie were the silent
the overall humor is really great in this movie .
also of course the musical moment were more than great .
this is a really enjoyable light and simple pleasant early french musical .
that does not mean that the movie is not filled with some great humorous dialog ,
is a technical really great movie ,
with also some great innovation camera-work in it and some really great editing ,
that create some fast going and pleasant to watch enjoyable sequence .
there is never a dull moment in this movie !
is especially unforgettably fun ,
you will ever see ! 8/10
this horrendously bad piece of trash manage to be racist
and boring direction make this movie one to steer clear of .
is to have had carl gottlieb and steve martin revive the nation 's favorite poor black family.and `` dcreasy2001 ''
but the film is undone by poor characterization
and a laughably bad ending.the main problem i had was
that just seemed like a boring
but fails at inspiring any sympathy for him .
as personality.one of the biggest disappointment of this movie is the ending .
the last few scene suddenly and terribly devolve into the worst kind of hollywood pap
the revealing of the film 's mcguffin at the end is poorly done ,
before some of the film 's main plot thread were resolved.the movie 's not all bad
not too long ago.what a disaster .the acting was atrocious.there were some absolutely pathetic action scene
a bad editing fades a little more the film with this bad habit from rapp
who recognizes great film
cat in the hat is the worst movie i have ever seen
that he is really annoying ) .
the silly songs the cat sing were boring and monotonous
and viewer must suffer through poor dialogue .
not funny
( i remember some awful comment about a garden hoe
do not waste your time .
see a good movie ! 1/10 star
the plot twist and turn and poor old morgan ends up
.director natali handle proceedings confidently and certainly has a great ability
is fantastic\u0097his portrayal of the initially somewhat nervous morgan is played to perfection.cypher is another fascinating movie from a director
terrible
terrible .
the movie 's animation is very poor quality .
it really was that bad .
that obviously goes to great effort and length to faithfully recreate h. g. well ' classic book .
predictable hollywood fare
we enjoyed the effort
was perfectly acceptable and sometimes very good .
the united kingdom and australia produce the best movie and tv show for child ,
that continuity and great acting are important to younger person .
your old favorite as well as later non-favorite.there was always a tug-of-war pitting quality-conscious executive producer barry levinson
that demeaned it.unfortunately for this movie
of carrying the whole mess on one of the weaker cast member.briefly ,
unfortunately
while time wasted on jon seda and michael michelle could be better spent on commercial .
the best show on the air and one of the best television production ever.it is fun to watch top pro do their stuff ;
this had to be one of the worst film ever .
another bad scene was
andie 's acting is so bad in this film - i could not connect with them or feel
this starts off bad ,
who tells the best 'man ' story ,
and then it gets worse -=- spoiler alert =-= what with andie 's character falling for the young organ player
in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth .
with excellent comedic acting ,
but makes fun of the soviet mentality through and through .
all this deep philosophical commentary is wrapped in a funny and entertaining package ! jur
their voyage was heroic to say the least.please reply to this message
not that sap at sea is a bad film -
but that actually is not a bad point for it .
that it is a bad case of `` horniphobia '' ,
unfortunately the goat gnaws the rope until it eaks and the ship sails off .
also unfortunately
and they all make a funny film -
who realizes what a stupid comment
and a good conclusion to the best year of their film career
which many of the reviewer here seemed to hate - gives another great message :
that so many `` critic '' here would rather have immoral message ,
and stanwyck has some great line
two great comedian in a great neil simon movie
he is as sharp and as funny as ever .
i especially enjoyed the `` knock
( stunning set and beautifully photographed )
but they succeed wonderfully !
and add one of the most subtle underpinning of many genre clich\u00e9 and the actor ' own typecasting
7/10
all of her movie are great .
rubyin paradise is one of her best .
it is one of ashley 's best .
this is in many way a technically poorly made film .
-- with some dialog and sound effect very poorly slapped over top the film .
with excellent camera work
it is by no means a crumby waste of time.though
this short-ead of a film should be enjoyed as an appetizer for the title reference and the viewer should relax and roll with it .
fails to draw in this audience.beautiful scenery and cinematography
beautifully shot -
and perhaps you will not be as disappointed
this is a wonderfully spooky film .
he did a great job
you will not be disappointed .
great pitch right ?
usually ridiculous in sci-fi movie
however the time transport sequence itself is trippy as hell and quite beautiful ,
is probably one of the best of its kind in 70 's action/war movie .
grenade and tank.this mish-mash of style is with one foot firmly rooted in the sprawling jidai-geki epic of kurosawa 's kagemusha or hiroshi inagaki 's samurai banner ,
( like the wonderful slow-motion shot and bloody violence )
it is just that it does not try to pander to so-bad-it is-good audience
the song themselves are pretty lame and corny and detract from the whole thing .
a badly executed portrait
the script is dreadful and the movie
add to this a truly terrible print quality
they are fun to watch .
that i found it a complete and awful bore .
although it was funny in some place ,
to talk about and the acting in some place was dreadful and wooden
the redeeming feature of this film
this is one of the best jodie foster movie out there
it has wonderful performance
by no means is this movie as bad as 'perfect stranger ' ,
but it just was not funny .
although there were some pretty funny slapstick moment
no one was very particularly funny or outstanding in any way .
'schindler 's list ' was funnier
in her worst choice of role .
and poor ian mcshane
the story drags and is completely predictable up to and including the end
i would be in for the best movie watching experience of my life .
the film adaptation of jame joyce 's ulyss is excellent .
the milo o'shea does an excellent job as leopold bloom
shows us one of the best british film from that
has to be one of the most amazing thing on any film.much
so our comment will be about the great acting powell
he was an excellent film actor
peter and june fall in love at first sight.some of the best british film actor grace this film with their presence .
an excellent star turn by marius goring ,
is one of the best thing in the movie .
does one of the best appearance of his career
'the art of seduction ' is insulting - insulting to its character
insulting to man and woman
and insulting to its audience ' expectation .
it takes the awful beautiful person
and i was amazed at how much i enjoyed the vehicle end to end .
brisson and carlisle are relatively bland ,
with an excellent sense of timing
( blood dripping on one chorine 's white skin was wonderfully chilling ) ;
detective philo vance 's power of observation seem greater than all the oriental sleuth of the era combined
as i had previously loved both lock
i would be very disappointed .
as great as guy ritchie has just done with this movie .
played as an inspector-turned-alcoholic character.the role conveyed the message of the end result of a honest cop
which ultimately won him the best
this is easily the worst movie i
if this was made recently i am sure the directing at least will not be too bad :
great way
great idea !
`` perhaps my favorite inconsistency in this movie is the way
my point is that this goes on the bottom of my top 5 worst movie of all time list ,
and it is rare that a movie ever reaches that point .
that happens to be nothing more than boring
but i certainly enjoyed the movie .
but we got a great laugh out of it .
this version of bleak house is the best adaptation of a classic novel
and the cinematography is superb .
this film really got off to a great start .
that someone was finally making a beautiful film for its own sake
then mess it up halfway through
there are subtle nuance of strain and note from the string
( 1996 academy award 's best foreign language film from the netherland )
it was pretty bad .
not star war prequel trilogy bad ,
but bad nonetheless.i am not sure what the running time was ,
and extremely fun to watch .
annoying as all hell !
absolutely perfect for those role .
not saying they were horrible ,
perfect to watch around christmas and ings a wonderful christmas feeling
its a crappy sequel rip-off with more unrealistic trap and a stupid new main character kid
monarch cove was one of the best written
this could be developed into a great primetime soap .
i absolutely loved this show
loved it .
a somewhat dull made for tv movie
that is the worst part about this movie is ,
but that is a small silver lining in an otherwise disappointing movie .
that i give this show a 9/10
my favorite part of this show was the scene
it is a rare show in that i liked every character
was not nearly as funny ) .
of what is at time fun ,
.is it with the great interest and depth of a ken burns documentary ?
( for better or obvious worse )
for enough of a fascinating view .
a wonderful
bad synthesizer piping
of where the best part of koya were shot
was pretty disappointed ,
this movie was really bad .
while sleepwalker was bad ,
it was a beautiful kind of bad .
because tanya is one of the dumbest female lead in horror movie .
it is just so deliciously bad
bad casting
that is a lot of cat '' .4/10
and directed and starred in the greatest movie of all time
even if the movie was not particularly predictable ,
just avoid it.also starring pamela franklin and michael ontkean .
great film .
santa claus.the film is so great
and then we wonder ... what is so bad about this ice cream ?
movie makes you think.this movie has the best rendition of santa claus ever .
this movie is bad is an ignorant fool .
i loved this flick
ron leibman was hot and very funny !
that this little gem will always be a treasure of mine and a movie
it is military humor at it is best and worse !
so far this incomprehensible mess has no real story .
and a bunch of bad actor
some really bad c.g.i.
some incredibly stupid dialog
more bad c.g.i. ,
all in all very obviously an ill-conceived first effort at commercial film-making by the good person at tbn.tbn picture has had great success in the past
and who loved `` china cry '' ,
do not waste your money ... go rent
full of great atmosphere .
( 7/10 )
palme is poorly defined .
but we simply could not take the terrible quality of this movie.on the ight side ,
the animation is incredible
is beautifully photographed and powerfully acted .
you are not likely to forget.the film only weak point is the rather clich\u00e9d 'flower power ' teacher
is very steep and in a poor state .
gave wonderful performances.i am not at all sure
to sum up ... ..the play has a wonderful atmosphere throughout
with great character .
and i loved it .
before she would go on to win an oscar for beautiful mind
cuter and softer version of the pretty in pink 's and some kind of wonderful 's of the 1980 's ,
that what comes through best in their performance
it is a great film
that was fun ,
and unfortunately it seems to have permeated into child film as well .
but flying reindeer is a fantastic and wholly unrealistic concept .
which insults the intelligence
it is refreshing to have a show
who the winner will be.it is a great hour of entertainment
best of all in our hussle
who finds `` according to jim '' great television comedy ,
because i love bad movie and i love michael madsen .
jeff lowell has written and directed 'over her dead body ' poorly .
jason biggs is wasted ,
sadly
what movie should be : fun and entertaining .
the music in this movie suited jack wild and mama cass beautifully .
that jack had now makes this movie even more wonderful especially
where there is friendship and fun !
funny fantasy ?
( and even the cartoon color are a disappointment ) .
there is nothing remotely funny
and one of the very worst `` big '' movie ever made .
jane eyre has always been my favorite novel !
this is the best and most complete version of the book on film !
timothy dalton is amazing as rochester .
i would avoid this film
sadly
for a start the special effect are really bad
it might look ok but in 2003 there is just no excuse for visual as poor as this .
that the dvd cover claims very proudly 'from the special effect creator of jeeper creepers'.secondly the direction is weak ,
it simply is not.all in all this is a pretty poor film ,
it is still probably best left alone.a rather sad 4/10
that the performance are slightly weak at time ;
he was incredible !
but he too was incredible .
every shot is planned to understated perfection .
the set is some of the most amazing lighting work i
this movie is at the top of the list for best cinematography with lotr
the music is some of the most beautiful
10/10 one of the most moving and beautiful movie i have ever seen .
before he made enough of his great and of comedy ,
excellent supporting performance by eugene levy ,
perhaps his best work ever as the hot-headed sal dipasquale .
it is poorly researched .
maverick cop has his badge revoked by hardass lieutenant ,
it could have been great ,
mainly due to the utterly predictable plot
it is a great western with excellent acting and a great story .
this story is weak ,
my criticism is focused on the poor execution of the story ,
and is horrible in the music/score department .
( no matter how bad your acting ) .
i had great satisfaction
this is just a great
fun
this movie features great acting
beautiful song and dance number
and great design work and film shot .
there are funny moment ,
its amazing how though this movie may be set in a certain decade ,
if you want to see something great
this film was amazing .
by making all his best
a wonderful amusement for certain ain-washed and/or ain-washing western
one of the real best of the soviet era .
be they good or bad ...
so great.and what makes it better
than great is the story behind the movie .
little italian number of zombie flicks.so awful ,
it is wonderful !
love it.as a great trivia note :
i loved this movie .
romantic comedy tend to be shallow and not as funny
great script
the revolt of the zombie is not the worst movie i have ever seen ,
a love triangle complicates the story some.this really was a tedious movie
with horrible acting
that are worse ,
it is bad ,
and not in a so-bad-that-it-is-good kind of way .
titanic has to be one of my all-time favorite movie .
it is enjoyable.when i stumble across someone
but is not it enjoyable and moving ?
does not everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story
dicaprio and winslet are terrible actor .
that they are terrible actor .
who unfortunately are very famous for a movie
that they are not amazing in .
is a bad movie
best cinematography ,
which i find to be the best i
the flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at time ,
but overall it is an amazing achievement
the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed.i can tell you
where they hit it.i give this movie 10/10 ,
humor and pathos are all wonderful !
the scene was compelling and beautifully crafted .
there are of course many great romantic comedy
the outfit where wonderful and any person
italian but badly dubbed into english.highly recommended .
and there is no plot and no redeeming value
that sounds great
1/10
john mcintire is excellent as the law of skagway with due respect for the trapping of justice over the reality of it .
only flaw in the film is that kate capshaw is extremely annoying as the `` i am right
and i loved all of them .
one spoiled beautiful daughter and two son as different as day and night .
the show was great
not a bad thing ,
this movie is about a dysfunctinal family
but not just any dysfunctional family .
this is a beautifully done film .
has portrayed gandhi wonderfully .
and was stunned at how bad it was ,
it featured bad acting ,
bad directing ,
sitting around making an on-purposely-bad movie
and took this idea in fascinating direction .
cypher is a fascinating exploration of one man 's place in the world ,
it is so refreshing in this day and age
they are unbelievably boring .
one of the great thing about cypher is the way
and launching morgan on an amazing journey through the labyrinth of his own identity.natali 's direction is exceptional
there are some amazing camera angle from above
as a modern day film-noir.the acting is uniformly excellent throughout .
jeremy northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage
his scene is one of the best
and it is a fantastic piece of writing ,
it is a perfect final momant
and it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable matrix.a fine follow-up from natali .
superb stuff !
that does not make it bad ,
be disappointed in an obviously for-kid movie like this.however ,
every time it is getting intolerably dull .
but that is not in itself bad .
a rating of `` 1 '' does not begin to express how dull
it aint bad ,
it is dreadful .
as all the actor in the film are great usually ,
and it lacks much of the energy a comedy needs
it is also got some laugh-out-loud funny line
and garofalo and studi do superb work adding conflict and variety to the team .
the best scene in the film give this film its emotional grounding .
amazing 's secret identity ; stiller 's rage
but the main plot is such loopy fun
( 7/10 )
`` journey of hope '' tell of a poor turkish family and their odyssey of hope
the story has a predictable conclusion
you will not be disappointed.i remember watching this as a kid in the 80s
and they loved it also !
is wonderful .
because at its best this program offered an often winning
'' plus you can not go wrong with such tried'n'true fright favorite as zombie
to tackle a heroic lead in `` the energy eater '' while other episode featured great veteran character actor like keenan wynn
best of all
kolchak was surrounded by a handful of enjoyable secondary character :
simon oakland was perfect as carl 's chronically ill-tempered boss tony vincenzo
and carol ann susi was likewise a lot of fun
( the titular lycan nothrope in `` the werewolf '' unfortunately resembles a yorkshire terrier ! )
that 'summer rain ' is by far the worse film i have ever seen !
that it was going to be a great british classic such as 'secret and ly ' or 'lockstock '
but oh no this was so bad
( reminded me of a bad 'theatre in education ' school production ) .
so please avoid at all cost .
rarely in ensemble piece are character treated so well .
i enjoyed the scene in the class immensely ,
i found the film very well-rounded and quite enjoyable .
there is no time wasted on unnecessary crap .
to require dull filler scenes.the cast is good .
kilmer has been mediocre in a string of movie ,
( she is solid ) ,
who is otherwise quite annoying ,
`` friend '' is the worst tv sitcom of all time . )
she fits in perfectly .
friz freleng 's 'rumour ' is an excellent private snafu cartoon
fast paced and funny ,
`` do not badmouth the military '' message .
it stands up as one of the best of the private snafu short .
great actor
who suffers greatly
clara bow 's beauty and wonderful appeal are the chief reason
`` hula '' is not quite up to par with clara 's best film
but it is still enjoyable .
the movie is boring ,
this movie is a big mess .
and extremely bad acting on everyone behalf .
the movie is great sleep therapy .
the fighting is laughable .
and his character was poorly developed .
this movie is highly recommended to pass .
ok this is not the worst film i have reviewed this week
we had a lot of fun
watching this piece of crap.the monster jigsaw is a mish mash of all these dysfunctional student idea ,
the absolute worst part is the ending ,
( how much fun we had mocking it )
73/100 acting 8/100 generally 12/100
this is among the very best
along for fun would be a detriment ,
-- having a genuinely interesting case as well as uniformly excellent performance by all.the film begins at the dog show
this was one of the worst movie i
horrible acting
not funny at all
and well just boring.i can only assume all these 10/10 fav .
attempt to sit through this awful movie.otherwisedo not waste your time
the dancing part was horrible.my ex said
why we never married.this is one of the worst movie i
it is too bad
is that isabella rosselini gets more beautiful the older
cusack does his best david niven in this one ,
but still be pretty d*mn funny ' reworking of an under-appreciated comedy classic.hillary duff does an over sexualized britney spear lap dance version of matum bond .
it was so fun .
because their wonderfull castle is very big and beautiful .
unfortunately dominating the industry mind ! )
it is great !
great writing and great casting along with great acting makes this a must see .
i would like to use it as my avatar on a message board
it seems absurd now that this mostly boring little film had been banned
and actually being able to sit through this mess of a movie .
as it shows from the cheap props for his show
( yes it looks even cheaper than the real jerry springer show )
the thing is he really looks too horrible and out of shape
but if your idea of fun is seeing jerry springer sing a country song about his own show or guy hooking up with transvestite ... well ...
so he invests this overly complicated and needless pointless plan ala scooby-doo to drive alan
my god what a waste of time .
and that it does an excellent job of portraying the charm
this is way up there in the `` so bad it'good `` chart kidman
how freaking amazing this film was .
it is by far one of the best independent film i
there were great expectation for this back in 1982 \u0096 a script co-written by the wild bunch 's walon green
without semaphore and a great supporting cast
unfortunately
sadly ,
it is completely wasting the great warren oate in a nothing bit part .
why i found this so forgettable at the time .
it was very funny indeed .
it was not as bad
that you can at least expect some funny dialogue .
of protecting his country or the right of his fellow protestant ... ginger is in it for the fun of killing .
and they add fuel to the flame ,
worst .
which boat in the marina belonged to the recently departed steve ? 1/10
i enjoyed it .
perfect !
`` emma '' is one of austen 's most delightful and funny novel
the movie respected this subtle irony ,
toni colette is simply great .
a really enjoyable and deserving movie .
this movie is a perfect
that i 'enjoyed ' watching.7/10
i especially loved all of his funny facial expression and dancing during `` put on a happy face ! ''
he is so great !
she was a beautiful rosie ,
tyne daly was hilarious as albert 's obnoxious mother and george wendt was superb as the annoyed mr. mcafee
( however i loved paul lynde 's performance in the 1963 version ! ) .
this movie is disappointing
one of the worst movie i have ever seen with robert de niro ,
the fan is a pointless clich\u00e9 of an exercise in slasher flick .
perhaps richard attenborough was not the best choice for director of the film ,
douglas is also probably not the best choice for the part .
in all fairness this was the weakest part of the film .
another stupid dinosaur movie
the original was bad enough ,
the sequel was even worse .
2/10 .
to have amazing gadget and whizz-bang explosions.in many way ,
and was rarely central to the plot itself .
airwolf was rip-roaring fun ,
( and sadly vastly inferior )
this is a fun
fun movie .
a high school nerd is picked on by all these stupid jock and cheerleader ,
a lot of thing could be so ridiculous ,
it really is a fun
fun movie .
good fun !
great 80 's slasher fun !
'blackadder the third ' is the best one of the series.actuelly all the episode are funny ,
in 'macbeth ' is also really funny
he did the series of blackadder especially good.i hope rowan is going to continue his great style ,
a really great movie and true story .
dan jansen the greatest skater ever .
a touching and beautiful movie the whole family can enjoy .
thank you for a great film with excellent actor and an excellent story .
though as such those same limitation make it disappointing.what is interesting too ,
when i was younger and prior to five year ago- is that the basic element of the story never get messed up with .
i found to be really amazing
they are maybe the best part of the combination of the animation on top of the live-action
are beautiful with the mixture and blast of color together .
label me disappointed .
while watching tashan \u0097 the mega-disappointing
bad film are bad film
but tashan is not just a bad film ,
it is a terrible film .
terrible
terrible also
that is hidden across the length and eadth of the country.much like those bad eighty potboiler ,
that it fails to establish any connect .
even that ridiculous climatic action scene complete with shaolin monk
not all these set piece are badly
it is rather disappointing .
most disappointing is the end .
this is one of my favorite mr. motos ,
the usual comic relief is quite funny here ,
and fun.the archaeologist does not have quite the same flair as thomas beck
while he speaks in a stereotypical manner his line are funny ,
this movie is fun in fit
for it not to be fun .
they really do not make bad horror movie like this anymore ,
add paulie the parrot to beloved movie animal character .
bird and beloved marie
beautiful photography throughout .
great little movie
word of mouth will make it a cult favorite .
and the finale is quite disturbing.the acting is excellent
alone at night with the light off.highly recommended.10/10 .
filmed beautifully catching the drama of life in the 30 's .
hank again prove to be excellent in a very memorable movie .
'bill and ted 's excellent adventure '
that short story for the first time.in the case of terry gilliam 's excellent film
although his character is not especially sympathetic .
it sounded great with dts.i had to get this dvd
was just mind blowing and sound quality is the best i have heard on a music dvd.it does not matter what type of music you like ,
bad bad bad bad.how about the acting ?
i find it fascinating
my especial favorite was jack wild .
drawing the eye with beautiful scenery and tranquil landscape .
due to the excellent cast all five of the major player are wonderfully interesting and dynamic .
it is a really funny movie
and the amazingly difficult but equally rewarding process of forgiveness .
she was such a great actor
but she really seemed to be in character perfectly .
i felt so bad for the girl
which is just so heartwarming after all the mishap in the movie.definitely a gem ,
the acting is just horrible especially with rick ' s fake crying for his other ,
and the make up is just lame .
this film is so horrible ,
by it is greatness .
fantastic script
great acting
should become a writer yourself.great ,
that is a great plus ,
i like swayze but in this he is awful .
alison.the best acting came from the person from the african continent and sided onyulo as umbopa i liked best .
and the cast is wonderful .
who tries to avoid woman and their traitorous way
the dialogue is wonderfully witty and refreshing and the atmosphere enchanting .
yes way ! bill and ted 's bogus journey is simply the best movie ever made.who dares
loved this series
my favorite character was the one
i am not great at writing review ,
so i will just spout my opinion ... i loved this series at first .
davis ... i loved them all .
the movie stargate seemed mediocre the first time i saw it ,
it is a great loss .
but it is rather insulting really to make a sequel to one of the most favoured horror trilogy ,
it is cheap looking ,
just do not waste your time on this drivel !
this is definitely the worst bigfoot movie i have ever seen
the actor and actress were horrible
and the bigfoot itself was terrible .
it looked like a poor man 's version of donkey kong himself !
was just awful animation .
that was annoying
the movie is boring too .
absolutely one of the worst film i have ever seen .
truly awful !
1914 was an amazing year for charlie chaplin .
this is a very forgettable film
is not particularly funny
about a sad reality the acting is great and the soundtrack too .
this may be the worst film adaptation of a broadway musical ever .
that it is almost bad enough
sardonic and funny .
clich\u00e9 and quite disappointing .
and learn how to cook.bend it like beckham is a very funny feel good movie
the story is simple and predictable ,
but it works perfectly
and the script is very realistic and very funny.a great family movie 8/10
that the enforcer is the best out of the series ,
with great
this is in my opinion the best dirty harry sequel ever .
so these viewing angle make it worse
but this one is trying too hard to be something artful and fails in my opinion painfully.nothing to get attached to
what an annoying film even for someone
he ought us wonderfully
it had dire theme music ( up there with the bodyguard for cheese ) and the pointless love story was so tedious
and disappointed
the worst aspect was
culture vulture went to see this expensive waste of celluloid
if person are stupid and sentimental enough
it is right up there on my all time worst movie list with other silly
that transforms a great movie or a great script into a masterpiece ,
even king himself did not fare so bad .
coming from a streak of fantastic performance for robert altman in the seventy
what a horrible film .
unfortunately it is not worth watching .
its beyond boring
that plus the outrageous photography together with the hauntingly beautiful music ,
you will not be disappointed .
was expecting some of the worst film
that it was the worst rated movie
this movie needs to be banned from all shelve around the world.the best way
and the special effect really are just terrible.please do not be like me and rent this movie
it will be funny to watch.in the end i am
it is lackluster and cheap looking ,
not only is this a great african-american classic comedy ,
those were some wonderful memory ,
`` 10/10
it is not the best or the most ... .
that makes you feel good after a bad day
without any regret about the time wasted
this is one of the most beautiful and refreshing film
unfortunately
the studio had to experiment to see what the public best liked about here .
which become simply boring ,
but it is awful .
even the fantastic cast can not save it .
it started off quite funny
that just were not funny ,
its like he was trying too hard to be funny .
it is getting worse ,
really terrible movie .
robert englund gives another great performance as freddy
that this is the most boring movie i
there are almost no redeeming qualities to this film .
but some real story are best left untold.i usually like slow paced movie as long
the acting was pretty bad .
no interest what so ever.a perfect example of what i call an anti-movie .
that this movie is by far the worst i
this movie is just bad joke
after bad joke geared to the 13 year old
who are in need of help badly
who he in turns gives his life to.the acting of this film is great ,
she has been in some bad some good
up until then it just seems like a pointless love story .
hell sometime it was even downright funny.the underlying message i got from the film though ,
being slutty or lambasting some poor guy for no apparent reason .
the message involved is good for woman or gay men.but ,
but some of the comment other have made are just plain stupid .
best film ever my foot .
rodney dangerfield is a great .
he has done a lot of great work .
but this one ... .is awful .
the joke in the movie are not funny ... .their stupid .
that was visually fantastic
worse than that
and gets even worse at the big groan-worthy twist at the end .
worst of all is the overlong `zion rave ' scene .
but it is also a pathetic excuse for porn and depressive dance music.the bullet-time aspect of `the matrix ' was a good addition ,
but in `'reloaded ' they overuse to make it seem boring .
that other franchise such as the `star war ' saga have.the acting standard is poor for the most part .
the best character of course goes to hugo weaving 's `agent smith'- the only one
academy award nominee laurence fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with poor dialogue .
`the matrix reloaded ' is a disappointment .
this is still rather poor .
4.5/10 .
( and looked like one of the bad guy )
by far the worst editing since `` manos hand of fate '' .
so if you wan na see a movie with poor editing ,
poor acting
horrible
this was actually disappointing enough for me to toss my discs from the first 3.5 year .
`` hole '' is my all-time favorite movie !
the director of this film did an excellent job of re-creating the book into movie form .
did wonderful playing their character
10/10 star
unfortunately
she makes a wonderful jane .
gemma jone has some good moment as anne
it was funny and interesting and the main character was kind of cool.i saw
it was horrible .
it was funny before but now ... i did not laugh at all .
the story was weak .
there are great actor in this movie
but still the acting is mediocre at best.what is the worst is the fact
that the only black man in 'the street fighter ' is one of the bad guy
and only one asian as a bad guy .
i am giving the movie the rate of 4/10 .
it would be 1/10
if i had not have fun with it as a kid .
this is one of the greatest film
played by ned beatty undergoes one of the greatest on screen transformation
completely giving himself in to this wonderful role .
with wonderful cinematography
i gave it a 10/10 ,
and put it in my 10 all time greatest film ever made
this is without a doubt one of the worst movie ever
what\u00b4s worse
perform so badly you can\u00b4t help but wonder
( a stupidity
it was horrible .
unfortunately
it is not that he did bad ,
boring to the max .
the poor production value
there are some incredible fight scene in this movie
that made my favorite hong kong film ,
that this story is not quite realistic.i loved acting
but the greatest thing in the movie was the wit
it features a lot of fun cameos and muppet hi-jinx .
i happened to have enjoyed it greatly .
fun to watch with your kid .
it is some weird bad rip off version of stephen king movie `` misery
and as in every bad movie
that to get the best version of the work of jane austen ,
the 2007 version was a disappointment .
and was fun to watch ,
and therefore my english writing is rather poor
a vhs tape of this wonderful tv presentation .
is a rare achievement for tv movie.secondly ,
all of the cast member did a superb job.my only complaint with the movie
i enjoyed the building suspense
annoying
or even the horrible score by quincy jone .
that are laughably bad
that this movie is horrible ,
because i have seen worse ,
like i was jarred from one weak plot point to another throughout the whole movie
or they just had a bad actor
they are hard to avoid using
why so many bad film tend to overuse stereotypical character .
it is awful .
sadie 's character is yanked from one bad situation to another
this is a lousy picture
this superior inferiority to the original dumb `` blind dead '' movie is another trash bin waste .
and was throughly disappointed ,
how boring this crude is ?
the result is terrible
when pete fails a polygraph test ,
the terrible
and think its great !
its laid back fun ,
great film
you will be very disappointed to see
it may not have had the funding and advertising
giving fantastic performance .
great film .
and 'legend ' makes the very best cinema !
attempts the role of an indian chief ... `` winchester '73 '' is the story of a perfectly crafted and highly prized
it is beautifully shot
superbly edited ,
and wastes the only star talent
it is not bad exactly ,
the premise is wonderful ,
and i loved the voiceover ,
and poor michael park
best-selling horror novelist cheryl
( a solid and sympathetic performance by the lovely virginia bryant ) ,
gianfranco transunto 's glossy cinematography boasts a few fluid tracking shot and plenty of great atmospheric lighting .
cage is at his best .
jt walsh is perfect in his last performance .
dwight yoakum makes a film debut superbly in a cameo .
really bad day '' film .
sadly
it seemed i was in for a cheaper version of the mummy .
they unleashed an ancient and terrible evil
they stop off at a hotel for a refreshing shower and some pleasant small talk .
after this overlong and pointless middle section they get around to destroying the anubis monster in the usual way ,
this may not have been one of the best program of the series ,
these usually contained the message
important message
it is not that the movie is terrible ,
that may be part of the reason for my disappointment .
is modesty are one of the film weakest point .
this is a thought-provoking movie with overall great acting and superb balance between the story 3 main character
they are like that too in real life.overall a great underrated piece of filmwork ,
you will love this one.8,5/10
some of the segment are funny
the film has some great moment as well ,
one of the best being the segment about an old couple ,
the editing was perfect ,
it might be worthwhile for some and a waste of time for other.7/10
and creature movie are *always* fun to watch ,
i have seen bad acting ,
and picked all the worst try-out from it .
but the acting really was that bad .
and outright dumbest story i have ever seen put on screen
but it is trapped in the bad
cause dragon war is absolutely horrible .
a padded cell should indeed be left available.niamh cusack did her best ,
and this particular `` state of mind '' is best buried and forgotten ,
i was disappointed to see that the major complaint of the community
-- that moore was being paid $ 40,000 of the state of utah 's educational fund
and we get badly shot ,
we not only discovered one of the worst movie out there ,
even in a bad film
there is usually some redeeming feature ,
it was terrible ,
this was just simply terrible all over .
the acting was laughable
the script terrible
and even the special effect were shoddy at best .
this was a very bad film and one
see just how bad a film can be .
and this one is worst than the one with paris hilton ,
so i do not have to see his pathetic face anymore .
it must be sad to want fame so bad
the only good part about this film is the beautiful scenery .
this movie was long and boring .
where the two minister 's son have nothing to do but 1. norm chase a lame girlfriend
because nobody with a ain would make up such a stupid story .
best performance
it was an amazing achievemant for all those involved
michael can noton jone painted a wonderful portrait of the honor and dishonor
is a little insulting to me .
he is also a perfect person ,
he even goes through the worst kind of torture
i find human ambiguity far more facinating than human perfection .
but he is far from perfect .
she is beautiful ,
that are wonderful in their chicanery .
are his favorite word to his `` factor '' .
that a man of great noble bearing as the duke of argyll can be considered of greater providency then him .
that i find fascinating is the duke of argyll .
`` braveheart '' has some of the best battle scene
it is one of the greatest scene in film history .
the fighting style and the bearing of the two character in this duel describe the character perfectly .
it is one of the greatest momants in film history .
`` rob roy '' is actually one of the greatest written film of the 90 's .
but other than sounding like scotty from star trek and a couple of `` aye '' s for acknowledgemant
this has to be the worst movie i
to devote to a just-for-the-fun-of-it movie .
this started with a bad premise
and then just got worse .
but if you decide to waste your time on this movie ,
i would almost give it 10/10 .
the story line is great and well composed ;
the animation is great and the combination of femme fatal and film noir result in a great film
i enjoyed it more in french with english subtitle .
if you enjoyed this film
boring and mostly a showcase for the company
that is just plain stupid
the apprentice was once a great tv-show ,
an escape from the mundane and boring .
everything is shown with a wonderfully ight splash of colour
it made the most addictive and wonderful viewing
i have to admit to enjoying bad movie .
this one had a great box ,
it is not great art ,
with its in-joke dialogue and over-the-top gruesome stuff was our favorite of the evening .
it was one of the best `` party tape '' i have ever had the pleasure of watching .
what is unforgivable is the lack of an oscar for best music ,
brilliant !
this very typically and pro-british story was by a great screenwriter
power.roeg really is the perfect director to ing johnson 's stage play to the screen .
in which another 'actor ' has taken on his greatest role
and served up in new and fascinating way .
one girl in the audience is so annoying
what matters is that `` superman return '' is bad movie .
in cinema it looks just stupid .
why having a weak story for a starter ?
i am not questioning the lame money
is it that bad ?
acting is weak ,
kevin spacey is having fun ,
second unit is so bad
the funnier it gets
do not waste your time
and do not waste your money too .
the movie could not be that bad .
that it would be more enjoyable to slide down a razorblade slide on my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar then watch this movie again .
( why is it that bad movie always include such good looking woman ? ) .
to add insult to injury ,
but he should concentrate on real movie.this movie is just a waste of time - run away !
it is still bad.now scorsese and screenwriter wesley strick did not just remake the 1962 cape fear scene for scene ,
unfortunately this is one of the film 's problem .
but the overall script is also weak all around .
they are also just poorly written .
and is filled with apathetic and even ridiculous line
as well.now the classic version of cape fear was extraordinarily filmed with illiant lighting and a powerfully effective suggestive subtlety
the acting is not great either .
but he gets progressively worse
but she is called upon to play a real stupid character
containing nothing to be great on its own
and being crushed by the unavoidable comparison to the original cape fear ,
i found martin scorsese 's cape fear to be a very bad film indeed .
the best thing about the film are robert mitchum and gregory peck in their supporting role
**may contain spoilers**the titular topless heroine rescues another beautiful babe and her father
this footage actually gets real boring
tng 's semi-forgettable second season ,
still one of my favorite episodes.on a side-note ,
i am still disappointed
who anyone is and the venom themselves only know at best
this is a good solid little film
but is still a really good film to curl up with on your couch.around 7/10 .
it is too much fun !
( aielo pulling over at his beloved off ramp )
that there are worse adaptation
and worse rochester.this is without doubt the most exquisite jane eyre adaptation
director franco zerifferelli revel in beautiful long shot of snow
and sadly
each of them beautifully staged ,
is physically a perfect choice for playing jane eyre .
but unfortunately the script never allows her to expand the more passionate and lively side of jane 's character any further .
absolutely ridiculous .
that many viewer are disappointed in hurt 's performance .
who is badly played .
but at least you will find a beautifully made movie .
freebird was expertly written and directed with the perfect combination of fun and serious moment plus choice casting .
what i love most about this genre is its incredible attention to detail ,
poorly cast ,
terrible script full of hole
terrible special effect ,
good gored up fun filled with predictable twist and laughable one liner .
i highly enjoyed this movie ,
it was meant to be enjoyed .
and have a fun night with some friend and this movie .
even by 1936 standard the acting in this film is bad .
but is totally wasted ,
the government of great britain and the united state have thus far made no commitment
that great britain has not forgotten them ,
a sympathetically doltish terry-thomas and john addison 's full-on larky score
thing quickly slow down into a series of slow burn and lame miscommunication joke .
is so pathetic its honor guard faint at the airport ,
allowing for another lame aural gag by a thick-accented announcer :
bannen is dull and plays his part as straight
that they are apparently cousin is never addressed.the film winds up with a lamely staged revolution
this movie was horrible .
ice-t was annoying as hell .
this one takes a great cast
where are all the great british writer hiding ?
person 's proved a screenplay with bizarre twist and fantastic idea about the nature of time \u0097 i especially love the idea
perfection and originality.the story itself is engaging :
but because their time-travelling technology is not perfect ,
and from that a illiant science fiction thriller with shade of film noir ensue as the multiple piece of a huge jigsaw start fitting together
to create a mess ,
the scene between jeffrey and cole in the madhouse are the best in the movie
but it is beautiful and full of sensibility ;
and it works perfectly .
but i enjoyed watching cole
which will blow many mind away.there are two great ending in this movie
the way jake gittes mess everything up the more
twelve monkey is a great movie to watch
came together beautifully
and diane keaton gave a wonderful performance
that are flawed then this movie is bad .
a great ensemble cast
unfortunately
the superficiality this creates is not just annoying ,
even by the terrible overacting in this
to live long before the film finished.avoid this like the plague and watch 'deep impact ' for a reasonable film about a meteor
only a naive girl could undertake such an adventure.robert siodmak directed this film noir very well .
who secretly loved him .
immature and boring !
`` boring '' !
the theme song is terrible and irritating !
also the story are lame
how this show got 7.5/10 vote of other imdb viewer .
cheaply made and boring .
but this is a total waste of money and a complete and utter waste of your time and feel glad
2/10
because i have given other show worst !
and is surprised to be tapped on the shoulder by the stunningly beautiful elizabeth blackwood .
this is a fun movie ,
recommended !
`` godzilla vs king ghidorah '' is a perfect example
about `` japan is great ''
is really stupid .
making them stupid big blond guy ,
and it is ridiculous enemy in one
the film was really dull and pathetic .
what begins as a perfect crime begins a struggle
and all through the houst is among tale from the crypt 's best .
until goldie hawn arrives.i never expected the youthful hawn to deliver such a solid performance .
her timing was great
is beautiful to watch .
it is filled with bad acting and even worse direction and editing .
the only redeeming part of the film are a few number by streisand ,
the final streisand number _could have been_ one of the greatest finale in film ,
the single framed shot of her face for the duration of the song was a terrible mistake .
the final musical number is the only redeeming part of this film ,
this is a great movie from the lost age of reactionary made-for-television drama .
but what really shines in this is the great pace of the movie ,
the car are really great as well
not mean it is not great art .
the movie has a weak plot ,
but what made it worse was that the major plot hole was the whole story on how to kill the baddy ...
yet the bulk of his film are more than forgettable .
which makes his character fascinating as well
than many film noir 's of the period this remains a great example of the genre .
by just have pointless scene
one of the worst horror movie i have ever scene !
the trailer looked fun so i thought
and the joke genuinely funny .
unfortunately
even she offered a great performance ,
it is just that someone has to be last of the best and sorry kiera
it easily ranks in the upper echelon of the worst horror film
and lacks the camp value of there is nothing out there .
( terrible on all level .
in great part because it has jame cagney in the lead role as a musical prologue producer under a succession of deadline
his high speed rant about musical show and so forth are endearing and annoying at the same time .
it is funny
because this is a very polished production.it is great to see cagney himself show off his superb dancing skill ,
cagney and blondell have excellent chemistry
is only mediocre
this is a really bad movie for several reasons.subject :
is that nietzsche was a great thinker .
who actually lived and had/has great influence on the world of yesterday
one of the first thing i noticed were the ridiculous accent .
bad casting.4th
its a waste of celluloid .
and this is possibly my favorite show
that this beautifully written and acted show was canceled .
steven caseman - are all incredible and so natural in those role .
even the kid are great .
wonderful show .
it was in the perfect time slot in this market .
but the overlay of moving image on an object on film is surprisingly well done given
the character are so annoying .
who the hell would ever produce this waste of a film ? spoiler up aheadthe teacher dies in this ,
if you are going to eak the rule do it in a good horror flick not this waste
bad script
it would have been a fun movie
unforgivable crime.the story line is as subtle as a ick through a green house window .
the guy is at his best
it only comes across as a pathetic attempt
but they are subtle ,
alone he was fantastic
which makes it seem all the more real.i would give it 8/10 .
this is an excellent movie .
the rest of the cast is solid .
as she does her hair and lewi describes her sad and pathetic life .
fun and quality film .
which give a great effect on the film .
as did the fairly lame musical score ,
beautiful cinematography i think not .
this movie was not too terrible
worst part of this was that madchen amick had such a small part ,
too bad .
spielberg 's `` duel '' and `` the bird '' are all great example of movie
their not especially bad
but ultimately fails in that in many way
i have seen much worse film ,
and disappearance are not bad ,
it is just too average.4/10 .
simon and director gene sak do a great job
why they were regarded as a great comedy team .
matthau is great in the beginning ,
is not great comedy
to get into a great comedy ,
( plus it has some great shot of the seedier part of the city . )
and still makes it funny .
but the movie makes for a solid foundation
but still fascinating
other are simply boring .
of being both utterly repellent and totally boring .
my favorite line in the entire movie was from mr. petey
and my favorite scene in the movie was
worst show i have ever seen .
poorly designed suit .
but not the worst acting i have ever seen .
the actor ' acting goes from bad to worse ; much
much worse .
the villain are stupider than the ranger .
some weak
the poorly designed villain ,
does not make it credible.worse yet ,
if i tried.do not waste your time or money ,
imagine my dismay.this has to be the worst translation of a broadway show to film ever made .
i am sorry i wasted my time ,
it is that all this deeply entrenched and wonderfully enacted tension is swept away a little too lightly towards the end .
it has lost some of it is flair and greatness with age
watch it to have fun ,
christopher durang must have been taught by a memorably awful nun ,
the good earth is perhaps the most boring film i have seen in my life .
the beautiful effect
i love bad shark movie .
which is shark movie hilarity at its best .
messed up.this is theoretical reproduction at its very worst
a perfect amphibious being !
the deer hunter was great ,
this movie was great.it is the acting in this one
that makes it so great.for me ,
jacknife is a 10/10
the whole thing is really very dull .
the other user comment reflected the poor rating this film received
a wonderful movie !
like every scene was routinely predictable and signposted ,
like a very bad tv soap.i was really looking forward to this movie ,
unfortunately
`` october sky '' is his best effort
and obviously his best film .
and he gives a beautiful and natural performance .
he is a perfect actor .
an amazing inspiring movie along with load of entertainment .
that were meantto be funny ,
we have here another lame godfather clone from the director of il consigliori
if it is funny or scary .
someone even recommended the show to me .
it would have been fairly annoying
they waste little time in showing
`` vampire politic '' are more important than her.subtlety is not this show 's strong suit .
but the finale two episode was where it really got annoying
at this point it was just ridiculous .
running man is not a great movie ,
that it almost makes fun of itself .
in the ensuing scene \u0096 the best in the movie \u0096
pleasant but bland and generic
and a solid performance by the wonderful actor walter huston.the title and opening sequence of the film pretty much give away the fact
this is one of my favorite colman melodramas .
it is difficult to precisely put into word the sheer awfulness of this film .
german doctor have not been funny since vaudeville )
that is is bad enough .
which can best be described as 'ugly ' ,
they overplay even the weakest of throwaway gag.adrift in this sargasso sea of sap is a hapless billy crystal in his film debut role as the film 's hapless protagonist lionel .
eventually the cringe reflex becomes a semi-permanent condition as cheap joke
after cheap joke blows up in his face.i can only speculate about the sort of audience
but bad rating due to basic premise
being badly developed .
but no discussion of any great depth that would explain
directing was not that bad
i have seen worse ,
most of the plot aspect are pretty predictable and `` tried and true ''
in addition to an amazing resemblance
the younger actress did a great job
`` bait '' are not perfect .
believable and amazingly likeable
smooth as butter and funnier than hell .
but i would give it a 7/10 .
better or worse .
the fastway soundtrack is one of the best soundtrack ever .
kid 's favorite singer dy .
his great insight ?
unbelievable waste of film stock .
the movie was awful .
and ridiculous from the beginning.the `` deeper '' point is apparently
definitely the best movie i have seen in the past five year .
it is the worst data-animation ever
just because it is so bad .
`` this is the best movie i
the movie is to weak
i thoroughly enjoyed this flick .
this is mainly what makes south park soooo funny .
it has a sincere message about corporate america and the disgrace
but he is in surprisingly glum spirit
so called `` perfect job '' .first of all ,
this movie was very funny
but `` welcome to collinwood '' is great comedy for itself ,
really excellent movie for these actor :
( great ) ,
( great ) ,
they are just like character in my favorite comic
most of the screen time is dominated by unfunny joke .
this movie is as funny
as kirstie ally 's british accent is convincing.this movie started off like a weak action movie :
unfunny joke .
aside from the terrible writing
the movie is also poorly directed
and the acting is terrible .
it was just a terrible movie .
no one should waste their time .
one of the worst movie i have ever seen in my life .
who is totally wasted here.but
is much more entertaining than this stilted and bad film .
for this dull witted local `` comedy '' production is that it is inoffensive .
add up to fun .
just a great time.my rating :
and it was terrible .
hewitt is mediocre at best
you should avoid this film like the plague
it is relentlessly unfunny ,
dan ackroyd is pretty funny
but this film is just plain awful .
the story really is not that bad ,
than in most horror movies.i have seen worse acting ,
but at the end of the day this is still a bad horror movie .
by showing our weakness
to be to enjoy beautiful art and music ,
the classic story.the wonderful music of george gerschwin complements the great dancing by gene kelly and leslie caron .
loving film well worth watching.8/10
great wasted night stuff .
that they are tough football thug is laughable .
where every line must be pronounced in a perfect manner
the actor playing the role of the lover do a great job
though that the movie does not end on a bad note .
dull
dull
dull.it is not so bad
it is just plain bad .
snl is pretty funny but person
it is just a stupid piece of crap.andy samberg try to act like jon heder but fail .
although jon heder is only funny in napoleon dynamite andy try his hardest
that was decently funny with andy
he is a horrible actor
and the fun is lost.skip it .
not because the sequel was not as great ,
i did not rate it as a `` great film '' ,
and because i enjoyed their conversation
no matter how beautiful paris is ,
and it gets even better with an equally great sequel
his next film page 3 was one of the worst movie of all time .
one of the rich guy like to kidnap poor child
and order - svu.richard gere gives his best-ever performance as the soft-spoken agent worn-out by the task .
but he gives his best in his performance here .
her boss is played by the wonderful and divine holland taylor .
but then the network botch it up like a bad plastic surgery .
watch it with loved one ;
the acting in `` written on the wind '' range from weak to fair
he is convincing as the weak and spoiled playboy ) .
but she lacks the strength for the role .
( never loved by the disappointed father )
but the rest of the cast makes the entire procedure a waste of time .
stick with the visually perfect silent farce
recent adapted travesty 's like 'intimacy ' have ruined great writing .
eclipsing even my beautiful laundrette .
by having a very carnal relationship with the boyfriend of her emotionally-weak daughter .
beautifully shot
the film fails only in the weak depiction of the peripheral character
we may have enjoyed it as a light weight
that it looked really badly animated
that i found it to be rather boring .
is beyond ridiculous .
after one of her kid gets out of hand with his lame annoying joke ,
funny ,
without his girlfriend 's prior knowledge.horrible formula slasher does not stray from the norm .
often shedding bad joke..how
the costume are far too 'disney ' there is a ridiculous 'six month later ' insert after the burning of nic cage
punching out of various 'baddy ' on the island .
i have not watched a movie this awful in a long while .
it is that astoundingly awful .
her accent was awful
the one truly memorable part of this otherwise rather dull and tepid bit of british cuisine is steiner 's henna rinse
mst3k does an admirable job
of making a wretchedly boring and grey film funny.i particularly like it
but instead it was poorly executed .
why this film was not that good was the poor dialog
cheap laugh
the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie ,
who is my all-time favorite british horror wench
the bad aspect simply include
( who nevertheless made the excellent horror film `` motel hell '' and `` from beyond the grave '' )
those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously over-sized spider
if you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation ,
`` film noir '' is an overused expression
that made noir what it was
if noir involved nothing more than black-and-white photography
and rarely smile ,
his underplaying is perfect for the part .
poor tierney went through some bad psychiatric stuff ,
this is a good film as well as a good example of film noir .
although the bad guy are all bad .
by the catholic church 's st. francis orphanage.little delium did not waste any time
the movie as bad
this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life .
the topless scene lasted all of about 5 second and the rest of the movie was about as much fun
being forced to listen to roseanne sing big spender.the `` skit '' are stupid and consist of the worst kind of juvenile bathroom humor and locker-room gag ,
to crash through the wall and save us from the stupidity of `` vince offer ''
avoid this pile of rubbish .
which the two actress played superbly .
{ a } she lost her sister and father in a horrible accident and { b }
but this was just ridiculous .
i can not stop saying how much i loved this movie .
known and one of the funniest movie i have ever seen .
and the performance by all of these actor and actress are excellent .
rusty condieff has made an excellent film .
where it is funny
listening to the three lead try to talk some kind of philosophy was one of the best part of the movie ,
the funniest being of spike lee .
before the writing is just excellent.i am not surprised
unfortunately
`` 52 pick up '' ends with one of the worst throwaway conclusion ever ,
this is one of the worst movie i
on top of that the dialogue and acting was very poor and very forced
this could have been really funny
but it is poorly executed here .
this was one of the funniest and greatest sitcom
that the show is not placed amongst great sitcom
the actor did a superb job and season
although season seven was not as great when
it was still funny .
the other actor were not great
( don stark and tommy chong are great too )
season 8 was a little dull
but the finale was excellent .
douglas sirk 's over the top candy colored melodrama is still a wonderful thing .
the plot concerns the going on in an oil rich dysfunctional texa family
weak
and jealousy
but it is also terrible ,
and in a great montage
and had a long and fascinating career both in film and theatre in germany ,
sirk had a wonderful sense of color and design
a beautiful and touching movie
most of the movie is a meandering mess
bad acting
robert englund is fun to watch ,
( `` fast time at ridgement high '' )
they seem to be having fun and i was laughing a good amount of the time .
about how certain scene could have been funnier - not usually the best thing
because the film is a good example of film noir ...
jean peter and thelma ritter.criterion produces great dvds
of playing the cheap floozy
too bad ,
because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it.this an average film noir
but not great and certainly not worth owning at a price of $ 25- $ 35 .
and their life and experience represent the life of a great number of tokugawa era woman .
and sacrifice.i did greatly enjoy the art direction and the acting .
it is a great example of both .
i loved the new race
and many more ... most of my favorite scene are in that film:1-when vader destroys the emperor
( the greatest scene in star war )
9/10 .
that she is a great actress .
is it good or bad ,
me being a fantastic critic ,
i have great taste .
this picture in 1935 walked away with all kind of ocar for best director
gypo nolan made a bad mistake
gave a great
great film for 1935 and wonderful
a great movie .
lansbury and tomlinson are perfect ,
the song are wonderful ,
the climax with the attack of the armature is chilling and fascinating .
that makes a movie great..except for real actor .
and he should have won the best supporting actor award in blaxploitation ,
bad editing
who penned the excellent murder room series
and i was not disappointed .
which was very accurate and excellently portrayed .
the acting was excellent all round
an excellent character study
i have loved this book
that disney had ought madeline l'engle 's excellent book to the screen .
they had botched it badly !
never had i been so let down by a favorite book-to-film adaption .
-- cheated out of the great story
i have always dreamed of how wonderful a movie this book would make .
i was drawn to dan in real life from the excellent review and the thirst for a dramedy
their relationship was so beautifully done
that this movie was a waste of money ,
had some of the best action sence
though there were some funny line and gang throughout the movie
i mean for this kind of movie the 3d effect were great ! ! ! !
then at least this is a dvder ... overall i loved the movie ,
or i would be very angry for having wasted 2 hour of my life .
the acting was terrible ,
the plot was even worse .
who like to do their own version of mst3k .
but this is not bad ...
no one is great
but no one is terrible either .
it also avoids the obligatory
and the script does not insult your intelligence .
playing a bitchy faded actress.no great shake
but not bad at all .
and the writing is excellent .
when snl was actually funny .
this movie wastes virtually every actor 's talent
it was made by splicing together a discarded tv series.quinn 's mexican drug-lord role is laughable and his 'associate ' plucked right out of a 1970 's quinn-martin cop show .
and will jump the first hot body coming along.definitely a 'b ' movie at best and a huge waste of time for everyone involved .
which makes it quite disappointing in comparison to its predecessor .
a number of unnecessary and annoying new character
but it is still a disappointment ,
get annoying quite quickly.all thing considered ,
`` phantasm iii '' is an acceptable time-waster ,
but it is definitely disappointing compared to its predecessor .
i loved this movie .
best movie i have seen in a long time .
and plenty of funny line
this is an excellent film
dealing with a potentially exploitative subject with great sensitivity .
when she finds may 's explicit but rather poor drawing of darren
.the film 's strength is that it portrays with unflinching but sympathetic truth the nature of contemporary adult parent-sibling relationship ,
a rather lame overly-stereotypical portrayal of a sport-mad guy and an equally lame stereotypical portrayal of the gal
while being second banana to his overly zealous support for his favorite sport team.what i got :
he ings to the role the perfect blend of sport nut
fallon deliver his line with subtle perfection .
delivered with illiant subtlety by fallon.hey ,
and she loved it as much
this movie is totally ridiculous ,
including all the necessary ingredient for a horrible movie experience :
kate beckinsale is excellent as the manipulative and yet irresistibly charming emma in this tv-adaptation of jane austen\u00b4s novel .
raymond coulthard is perfect as mr. frank churchill
a great achievement and one to view many time with increasing pleasure .
the great director of italy of the 40s and 50s were man
the magnificent clara calamai does an amazing job as giovanna
giovanna is one of the best creation in ms. calamai 's achievemants in the italian cinema .
the last sequence of the film shows ms. calamai at her best in the ironic twist
that was committed.equally excellent
one of the best actor of his generation
gino is the perfect man for giovanna ,
as a buffoon.the film is beautifully photographed by domanic scala and aldo tonti .
the original musical score of giuseppe rosati is perfect .
who loved opera
and was one of the best director ,
because we see a great luchino visconti at the top of his form .
one of the greatest film i have seen this year.last maybe before sun rise ,
free will of man and our weakness against fate.with time past by jame and kathryn are destined to fail and an indescribable sorrow comes .
what i saw was badly acted ,
she can not even act.she is just plain annoying.paul rudd an actor
i do like comedy but not stupid one about stupid people.rating : *
it was all boring
annoying
and was annoying to listen to ;
and did a fast forward to the end.do not waste your time with this flick.beware of dvds labeled whitlow film and level path productions.and i am a practicing catholic .
with great soundtrack selection
but it is not the kind of fun ,
disney did a fantastic job with the same source material .
btw- it was funded by the ramtha cult ,
that here was a fitting follow on to the great godfather movie ,
again everything was just about perfect and i could not wait to see godfather iii ... ... ..
the character were weak especially the daughter .
pacino 's protege was a weak character
the pathetic shooting on the step ... .. corleone stuffing sweet down him with orange juice for diabetes
it is an enjoyable film suitable for the whole family
and the song are wonderful .
it centered on the poor chicago-based evan family and their struggle
and had great chemistry as jame and florida evan .
who made up for his lack of subtletly with artistic talent .
who was constantly trading insult with j.j. michael
it was no longer the great ground-eaking show
it has a strong message to the all generation .
who likes awful `` comedy '' show like little mosque on the prairie ?
if the show is good or funny at all
whose idea of comedy is incredibly predictable ,
badly written ,
but we still have lame duck like this hour has 22 minute and rick mercer
not to mention this poor excuse for `` comedy '' little mosque on the prairie .
this lame show is at all offencive or funny .
only mystery here is how oscar\u00ae winner f. murray aaham got involved with such a lousy script !
this movie is not terrible
a great appreciation of cuisine .
beautiful wife
this is one of my all time favorite .
and this has it ... one of my favorite is
i also really enjoyed walter m.s way of portraying einstein .
and quoting my favorite line as i watch it !
even the humor in c3 is funny
because it is bad .
definitely a high water mark in the 'so bad
if you enjoy the very worst of the worst ,
worst ,
the best story of these five cinderella is that of anita
i literary asked for a refund .
and it is still the worse movie ever found in a video store .
do not waste your money or your time on this movie .
and the horrible music made me sick .
this has got to be the best movie i have ever seen.combine eathtaking cinematography with stunning acting and a gripping plot ,
edison chen does a superb job
playing the part of the murderous pang.i rate this film 10/10 .
shame really - very rarely do i watch a film
and am left feeling disappointed at the end .
i enjoyed the first ... 45 minute ,
if cannon 's character was meant to be annoyingly funny
one measurement for the greatness of a movie is ,
such incredible performance .
having listened to and enjoyed harvey bernhard 's oman ii commentary i was shocked to discover
it is like a really bad tv movie
an excellent depiction of one of the more unwholesome aspect of that era .
i loved the visual
tom hank was really great in this ,
the best he can to see that happen .
a chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality tv gone mad .
considering the current state of tv show.the biggest message of all is 'you are being lied to ' .
that bug me is the poorly staged shoot-out
the new dolby 5.1 ex and dts es soundtrack are also amazing .
there constant use of the surround channel to great effect
definitely one of the best re-master i have seen so far .
and were loved.this is a sad ,
the invisible ray is an excellent display of both the acting talent of boris karloff and bela lugosi .
this is a perfectly delightful movie to watch again and again .
beautiful film
10/10 .
the best series has to be
( sanjay kapoor ) ,
and unfortunately for them
which fails to rise above the script .
sanjay kapoor is the surprise packet of the film with a sincere and effective portrayal
this is one of the best military film
it is a great human interest story
and determination.gooding and deniro are superb in the lead role .
it is wonderful to see the master chief 's racism evolve toward respect and love through carl brashear 's determination
the main issue is the horrible acting of the main three girl
and leaves the movie pretty dull .
and does give the film a big lift but sadly
to avoid ,
this is one of worst movie i
this is a great movie ,
i loved vanessa william as rosey ,
it was great .
because it has aged so well as a solid satire on the nature of heroism and the business of war .
( leaving out most of shaw 's best idea )
while the best of shaw has always been his idea and his dialogue rather than his bare plot
there are no `` good guy '' or `` bad guy
getting by on the best of their wit -
of this most traditional and traditionally funny of shaw 's stage satire ,
they should not be disappointed ,
( and despite the bbc 's uniformly beautiful and well observed physical production ) ,
i almost feel like having wasted 2 hour of my life ,
and without too long passage of boredom or waste of time .
i could easily manage to find one hour of walking around or pointless dialogue
its bad.as other have stated i am pretty sure the many 10 's given to this movie are from person somehow
a very funny east-meets-west film influenced by the closure of gm 's flint
it features great performance by michael keaton
the soundtrack was the best part of the movie ,
but poking fun at the nonsense
that were completely annoying .
the entire film was poorly dubbed
this movie was awful in the worst way :
a string of disappointing effort
an aging magician with cheap trick and tired stage-patter
unfortunately
is the no doubt predictable result of allen 's lengthy sabbatical exposure to london 's ubiquitous jack the ripper landmarks and lore .
the post-funeral gathering of journalist
to craft a perfect ambiance for a film .
that jack nicholson gives one of the greatest performance i
plus it features the actor with the greatest name of all time
unfortunately the ghost get ted
it is as pointless looking for historical accuracy here
collora may have to take some of the credit for poor scripting and direction.second ,
and make them empathetic with the plight of the main character .
the overall effect is rather disappointing .
is because a few of the great number are still able to be enjoyed despite the film 's attempt
and completely unfunny - a major disappointment after schneider 's hilarious performance in `` deuce bigalow
`` the story is stupid :
both beautiful and grotesque ... this is what 'art cinema ' was about ,
( though poor mandy should put her clothe back on )
what the film lacks is a compelling story ,
so wonderful to watch .
and simply too dull to be considered worthwhile.save your money ...
i can only recommend this film as a sleeping aid.4/10
this is probably the worst excuse for television programming since
nothing ever happened on this ridiculous `` series '' .
it is mostly just them making stupid
because they were painfully dull together .
i love bad movie .
die like a man are enjoyable action movie .
but this is really bad .
peter and david paul as the barbarian brother kutchek and gore are very funny ,
and they escape very extraordinary way.bad acting ,
bad special effect
very stupid story
bad direction ,
actually everything is bad in this movie .
it is hard to believe an `` action '' packed jet li movie could be so boring ,
a superb ensemble cast
tight editing and wonderful direction .
no brains.william h macy and sam rockwell lead an amazing cast .
george clooney should be congratulated for producing this gem .
two or three funny momant .
poor little mcnicol
was ridiculous .
poor little invalid girl ? ?
this is a great movie .
love is the greatest thing on earth
while standing between two sword is great too .
not to mention superb special effect for the 90s .
it is a great project for miike to channel his boundless imagination
some of the special effect are great though
was *meant* to look really cheap ,
his fighting incredible !
that is never boring !
if you like fighting movie with incredible non stop action
overrated bestsellerist like king
is actually not near as bad
but there is actually some surprisingly impressive touch :
this is a great adaptation and a great miniseries in its own right .
yes the law is drawn very badly in bleak house .
it fails the descendant of jarndyce
it fails the deceased tom jarndyce and rick carstone and all
of how to destroy a great script .
then update the production with bland
eggar is little better and lacks sensuality and the depth
is that even a great script and great dialog can be ruined with poor casting
because viewing it only underscores the 100 % perfection of the original movie .
this movie was by far the worst movie
it was poorly made
it was a waste of my time and money .
was the best part of the movie .
this was honestly an awful movie
how badly it was put together .
the audio was awful
because it show 's how awful it truly is .
great fun
it is so gratifying to see one great piece of art
i have seen much worse ,
while the acting was not terrible ,
but not great
unfortunately
.the greatest failure of this movie was the complete lack of any twist turn
this movie is great ,
made for some fantastic dialogue and sillines .
to replace this short-lived gem .
it is the worst thing
and i have seen some bad movie in my time .
it unless you like to waste your cash !
unfortunately
it is a great tragedy
to find 'the great inland sea ' the stuff of local legend ,
harris is worth watching for a wonderfully hammy
this is probably not a bad thing .
harris and his caravan eventually reaches the great inland sea ,
that the great wooden ape gets his girl and *spoiler* harris gets himself impaled on a huge elephant tusk !
good or bad deserve more than four comment ?
and this movie is not bad at all.the first thing
boone does turn in a surprisingly good performance as nick .
arthur o'connell is the perfect choice for the role .
jeannette nolan is a lot of fun as henrietta ,
great to listen to
and quite funny at time .
is equally entertaining.the best thing about april love ,
with the title song april love being the best of them .
you will find the whole film beautifully photographed
best of all is how the dislike between nick and jed is portrayed as each try in some way
will never be confused with great cinema .
they are fun
they always have a positive message along with fun entertainment .
dee dee is a wonderful singer ,
she has a great voice .
moe is a great dancer .
our favorite song is the bird song .
who initiate poor naive debbie rochon into their clique .
easily the best b-rate actress in the business today ,
and found it to be funny
and found it to be almost as funny but just as heartwarming and entertaining .
and contains many message of real life .
( i found only the egyptian one disappointing ) .
i found sean penn 's piece one of the very best in the collection
i never laughed so hard at a horror movie before ... a ridiculous plot with 3 character
you want to watch an absolutely written horror movie with stupid dialog
messed up plot
wasted character
bad sound and lousy development overall ,
and to sit through it for the entire duration makes you either stupid
this movie was horrible .
and some funny part in the movie .
the little kid in this movie is annoying ,
and the nudity itself is lame and nasty .
has not been in such bad movie in the past ,
should be ashamed.the best song is `` stay away ''
it is one of the greatest movie
it is just the incredible adventure
it is instead quite possibly one of the best depiction of the inside of a child 's mind i have ever seen .
not only is the artwork beautiful ,
but the use of perspective from the kid ' eye is just amazing ;
the absolutely perfect person for him right from the very start .
more and more of their true adventurous childhood spirit comes out through their kind word and beautifully realistic facial expression .
it is perfect for those
and a wonderful escape from reality for any adult
and was bitterly disappointed .
that straight away.my other gripe are that some of the situation just seem ridiculous ,
compared to song in previous manmohan desai movie i found the song rather disappointing .
and have loved his movie since i was a child .
maria bello is always great .
bad thing happen ,
they had a great time
the graphic were the best i
as for me i felt i wasted 2 hour
i 's still a fun scary movie
my favorite part : a guy gets so scared
but whatever.4/10 star
or 7/10
this still is the best routine .
`` damon wayne last stand '' is also funny in a tearful way -
all the joke are funny ,
and the time limit of 70 minute is perfect .
but unfortunately it fall short in its attempt .
it lacks the humor of a successful parody .
unfortunately
a whole lotta bad movie !
the dialog and the performance are awful
very bad
terrible
a complete waste of time .
only an absolutely boring story
playing a ridiculous senseless game
insulting each other in a very sordid way .
but the plot and the twist are so ridiculous
predictable
mediocre and unbelievable
do not waste your time or money on this garbage ,
( awful )
was fast-forwarding not only through dull
clich\u00e9d dialog but even dull
the best part of the film
are june haver 's beautiful costume and great body .
i was expecting bad sex joke and farting and a pathetic lead character
surprisingly original movie about a decent
but it is done much in the spirit of bad santa rather than sorority boy .
it would be nice to ruin one of the best show
they are all bad ,
that man are all `` bad ''
that all man are `` bad '' except for kindly old man
even the supporting male character are all `` bad '' ;
terrible `` bad '' man ,
the film is hilariously funny ,
i enjoyed this movie intensely .
the ensuing comedy is too funny to describe
one of the best foreign film i have seen in year .
this movie has always been a favorite of mine
and it is too bad
( poor video quality
it was still an engaging and fascinating movie to watch .
an amazing aspect of this film is just how many of its star ,
and is still is a tragically beautiful inspiration .
but unfortunately rarely achieved :
matthew jacobs has done a fantastic job of transposing the story of catherine storr 's novel 'marianne dream ' successfully to a screenplay .
will undoubtedly know.the casting is excellent ,
and not the spoon-fed tabloid reader - apart from a solid script
without insulting your intelligence
bad move .
this was so horrible ,
poor excuse of character .
i feel bad putting this movie down ,
it was made on a cheap budget ,
the beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mother 's love
lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle
the location are amazing ,
the music is wonderful ,
it is beautiful .
its dialogue are superb and intelligently written ,
a great deal of positive moment
karisma kapoor is eathtaking and very believable as nandini .
is simply incredible .
one of the greatest actor indian cinema has seen ,
another great performance comes unsurprisingly from india 's most underrated actress
and shahrukh khan provides great comic relief .
you will soon understand.pretty disappointing special effect and rather goofy premise .
are not so bad ,
but the lame plot
probably the best of the numerous sequel greenlighted ,
this film is harmless escapist fun .
where every single character is written and played as being so stupid
and while they were not the most amazing movie
that this was an acceptable use of studio fund and production resource ?
there is so much wrong with this movie that i can not write a really comprehensive review of it because it would exceed the maximum allowed word on this forum so i will just touch on the biggest thing wrong with it.the plot is generic uninspired and stupid and character are all about as interesting as watching paint dry for eighty minute but the biggest thing
he does not even try to make any of his joke funny
as i mentioned above most of the rest of the cast are horrible
even though some of them have been in some really great tv show
just hangs around on screen and wastes what talent he does have by being in this film.maybe the next film in this series will just be a soft core porn with a story line
and get an r rating this movie goes all out with pointless nudity vulgarity and pointlessly offencive sexual content
that it was part of a death scene that had a silicone casting of a east in it ) to avoid getting an x rating and he had no other choice but to do it or the film would not have been released
before it gets any stupider more crass and offensive ,
i could really learn some great new thing .
in improving the planet.this show should be called nagging with rachelle.since ed is such a great font of information
i was merely expecting another mediocre soft core copy of the much imitated `` emmanuelle '' series starring sylvia kristel .
the beautiful and exotic chai lee .
the beautiful doctor seems ok with this arranged marriage .
the film takes a surprisingly dramatic and depressing turn as this proud ,
i must also mention the beautiful cinematography and the bizarre and catchy 70 's soundtrack .
that you are watching something very rare
it makes it all quite annoying .
the dialog through the whole script is very weak ;
thats how pathetic it is .
then the rest is just bad .
lot of waste of time
that it deal with the issue of racism in the most ham-fisted and predictable way possible
nazi are bad ;
and anti-nazi is not exactly taking a hard stance on a controversial issue.higher learning is predictable
and in a word stupid .
avoid at all cost .
but they have this stupid rule
the sining was terrible and the song even worse .
a roadie for the great 70 's band strange fruit
this is quite possibly the worst movie of all time .
to produce this wonderful masterpiece .
the movie gets 1/10 .
this film has some great cast and staff .
and these talented person make an incredibly bad film ,
this film has something more laughable ; its problematic music .
i do not want to say this italianised theme of beverly hill cop per se is particularly bad music ,
probably because of it is poor message .
behind beautiful exploited talents.or do i
are person really so stupid
and a great western
not that duryea is stupid enough to fight for the rifle .
in it is a wonderful life
that i have really enjoyed some of his film ,
that the most overrated and annoying director can be both godard and fellini .
fellini has managed to make a story about a sexually compulsive man completely boring and unsexy .
instead of cheap sexual thrill ,
the sex act are choreographed in a silly and annoying way
-- especially since sutherland 's line are all poorly dubbed into italian
unfortunately ,
when the movie is not wrapped up in these boring sexual escapade ,
shown in this dull movie
i absolutely fail to see what is funny in this film .
`` oooo funny !
and the mother being wrongly accused of murder funny but against all odd this one succeeds .
the actor are excellent liam neeson
the setting is amazing .
it is terrible !
if all the character in this film were stupid ,
( so stupid ,
it is funny ... ?
how bad can a script and a director be ? ? ?
this bad .
because henry looks awfully ill. bert :
we will see this forgettable character ... alive !
looking worse
but the young einstein refuse to help the poor sucker .
the fantastic five come out running
that is funny !
which is also a lousy film ,
is way more funnier than `` cabin fever '' .
good.. its entertaining .. you get to see the most stupid plot
is it the worst western ever ?
but `` the last great american western ''
cheesy line come at you in wave ; predictable
if bad dialogue does not bother you ,
and the setting all look great .
some moment in the movie were unpredictable and rather transfixing ,
but is however surprisingly serious-minded in regard to its leading character .
is not bad ,
but frankly it was a poor choice.maybe this
to carry a weak plot with feeble dialogue .
this beautifully filmed and scripted episode was let down for two reason .
david tennant is such a great actor
he was quite funny
maybe the movie was a bad adaptation of the book ,
poorly dramatized
and eventually deteriorated to jar-jar 's annoying silliness.the agricultural detail were apparently drawn by someone
and acquires a great power
it has a great cast .
carrie-anne moss was great in a true departure from her day as trinity .
the kid were also great .
this is one god-awful flick .
but sadly it was to showcase the shoestring budget of this movie .
but the movie is shot entirely on boring
although if this movie were given a million dollar makeover and redone the story and boring acting and lame everything could not keep this movie afloat .
about creating what is practically a cheap knockoff of redneck zombie ?
earth-shattering.zombie '90 extreme pestilence is as bad
think about it.getting too specific with the story would be a waste of time .
or not this was originally meant to be funny
that was worse than this ,
1/10 updated 7/5/09 :
arising from intergenerational conflict through elliptical narrative and subtle imagery .
it is chock full of those cop clich\u00e9s and a very poor script with hole a truck could drive through
who sends baddie serial killer kober to the gas chamber
of possessing every weak minded person
through in the mix a very poorly realized psychic
but enjoyable as such
( much worse )
if you are looking for a great mind control movie ,
this satire is about as subtle as a ick to the face or a bullet to the head is more apropos for this scenario .
what is subversive or subtle about seeing a military guy masturbating to death and destruction ?
furthermore the acting is uniformly horrible
and you have the worst
the movie '' is still a great watch .
to once again portray their character and ing closure to an incredible program .
i enjoyed being left with a mystery
that you did not waste your new year 's day
that at least has some redeeming
what you get is sort of like a film-strip version of the cliff note of the books.it not all bad
what it could have been like with decent funding.this movie
have seen so bad movie ,
i have seen so really bad movie ,
to see why anyone with any dignity would appear in this.i got it really cheap ,
to set the time-line.i enjoyed the movie
however i was disappointed on both count .
and and just not very funny ,
and learn to write some actual funny material
this is hands down the worst film i
this is surprisingly above average slasher ,
that is enjoyable and well made
and the story is quite fun ,
plus molly ringwald played the annoying bitch extremely well .
and it was surprisingly worth it ,
plus i loved the mask the killer wore
as i loved
while predictable was very amusing as well ,
this killer did not mess around ,
and i loved it ,
this is a surprisingly above average slasher ,
that is enjoyable ,
job here with solid camera work ,
the acting is solid ! .
nonetheless she did an excellent job ! .
frank robert is fantastic as the killer ,
he was fantastic ! .
he does a great job
and he does an amazing job .
he was quite clearly the best character in the movie.this was certainly a performance
that he did not was disappointing and a true let-down .
his portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive .
these scene are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable .
the greatest similarity is to `` dead like me ''
this show never stopped being funny and charming ,
but it was still a surprisingly good and intelligent movie .
i would have liked to see what happened next.7/10
and it also pays homage to film noir.it is quite a psychologically complex film
it is slightly predictable at time
the acting is superb- especially joe mantegna- but someone
but also sport a bad 80 's hairdo .
jim carrey was perfect for the part all in all a great movie
in which it won an award for best picture .
with an excellent cast
my favorite performance were from youssef kerkour
there are some great effect with dragonfly and cockroach ,
does an excellent job with direction .
the audience loved this movie .
pyare mohan can be safely included in the blacklist of one of the worst-ever film
i gave it a 8/10 .
as their food supply.the gags in this movie are very funny .
this mess is so bad
debbie rochon 's talent is completely wasted in this film .
the rest of the actor look like porno wannabe and the plot is so lame i will not even mention it.do yourself a favor and skip to the end credits
you have a really `` bad '' movie .
the endless bound of our inhumanity to our own kind never fails to stun me .
and the reason i gave this film only 8/10 ,
weak and rather lame .
the two are not exactly on the best of term
the movie is still bad
it is not the worst movie out there ,
every once in a while in the wonderful world of horror ,
but it never fails to happen ;
that is nothing short of pure perfection .
the brit know their subtlety ,
the script is stupid and not funny at all
that is not funny ,
that is pathetic.low budget 'effect '
let alone funny.this movie is not even in the so-bad-it-is-funny category .
it is just bad ,
as if everybody involved was sick of it.avoid .
( never even saw `` bad news bear ''
who have gone on to great career
being in a less than great movie early on .
and just that title is funnier than all of `` tiger '' attempt at humor combined .
although this movie has some weakness ,
last year match was a thrilling affair with six of the best wwe had to offer .
2006 was a predictable and disappointing affair
and big vis tasted defeat against the wasted shelton benjamin with a little help
they do not get much worse than this .
the fight scene are terribly choreographed.the audio in the movie was pretty poorly recorded
and poorly edited .
cinematography is not great either .
she is easily the best actor in the movie
no weak part
( close to perfection in its imitation of reality ) ...
living in the fear of a few bad guy hire gunman
that a bug 's life is the funniest and best directed of all .
the humanisation process has been perfectly well achieved ...
especially for the last 30 second ... it is so strange and great at the same time
who made a great synchro work on this movie .
so being insulted by the movie
felt even worse
and even the use of the usually interesting locale of reno is as dull as the rest of the goings-on.it is something like several snl bit all pieced together ,
none individually too great at all
and the overall presentation even worse.whatever
'' `` bandit '' and `` bad santa
at the time i enjoyed the filming
unfortunately the producer never decided to transfer this movie to vhs ,
but i really enjoyed it the movie at the time .
because i am trying to work my way through a list of the `` great . '' )
ford is determined to bury it under over-acting and cheap sentiment .
as bad
that were funny .
this is that perfect movie they would show on comedy central .
were funny just do not seem as funny
this is not the worst movie i have ever seen ,
to fictitious crash victim was lame ,
avoid this one at all cost ,
this movie are going to be bad.after
what a pathetic movie .i almost did not finish watching this bad movie ,
to make this pathetic movie ,
all you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera .about 15 person with no acting skill
that were written by a couple of drunk person.in the fist part of this ultra bad move a reporter
telling tara zombie story.the fist of his stupid lame story must be the worst in history.his storysgt .
after letting the poor soldier private wilson do sit ups
and kill them for taking revenge on his behalf.the twist ending were so lame.even
i found this to be quite enchanting and beautiful in it is perverse tone .
not the greatest horror film i have ever seen ,
but it is certainly a lot of fun .
and the worst of all
this movie is none of the above.normally i do not bother with writing bad review for film but i can not believe
their search lacks any suspense-again
it was all pretty much pointless .
that culminates in one funny scene
this was bad .
( the lead is a combination of the worst of woody allen/paul provensa/reiser )
were just sickeningly bad .
while it is not exactly great ,
andrew lau did manage to pull off something enjoyable .
and i rarely give 1 's .
even for the lamest of movie i look for thing like music
but there is absolutely nothing redeeming here .
watching to see what insultingly stupid bit it would come up with next .
but let 's have some fun and pull this baby apart ,
it is worse :
so bad you can see the sweat .
that have been funny and thus ,
`` whipped '' are not funny .
this is a great film for mccartney 's and beatle fan !
quite amazing :
and was its best track ) ,
`` fame is great cause
i loved watching severed .
that is why igave it a 1/10 star
ifyou enjoy watching bad film
in order to poke fun at them ,
which at first was fun to watch ,
the way she was torturing him for an engagemant ring and the way
as beautiful as she is ,
how best to describe just how awful this movie is ? ?
it is not very funny .
add a bunch of musician impersonating actor - meat loaf is horrible
and deborah harry is even worse .
pity poor art carney ,
that this is going to be a `` b '' movie or perhaps worse .
by being worse than poor.let 's just say this .
against which all bad movie are compared .
and none are worse than roadie .
it was therefore very refreshing to see something resembling historical accuracy coming from that side of the atlantic
that is friendhip.with great
acting an intelligent and very funny script and the great monica evan and carole shelley as the british pigeon sister
is priceless and jack and walter are fantastic with a great chemistry.also
made into a successful and equally funny tv series with jack klugman as oscar and tony randall as felix .
i can not even begin to describe how bad this movie truly is .
why did the ending suck so badly ?
was enjoyable to me
of how horrible this movie truly is ,
he is a terrible actor ,
everyone had fun making this movie ,
its main fault is that it is just so ****ing boring ,
it would be funny ,
to see how bad it is .
it would be boring in any other movie ,
sadly
soderbergh 's untrue endeavor into neo-noir .
soderbergh remake robert siodmak 's decent noir criss-cross faithfully
however the adaptation drains it of every ounce of its state-of-the-art film noir atmosphere ,
who would later make wonderful crime film like out of sight and the ocean 's series with great style and atmosphere ,
nightclub have terrible ,
and less boring had it a few saving grace like a good score
unfortunately
that disposition works wonderfully
sofia and her stubborness good and bad
it would be great ! !
the graphic are great for ps1
that i love bad movie almost as much as i love great one ,
that i have finally seen one of the all-time legendary bad movie :
the almost indescribable mess
an adaptation of gore vidal 's best-selling book
the star-studded myra breckinridge is truly a movie so bad
the film went on to gain a near-legendary cult status among lover of bad cinema ,
and teach the school 's resident bad boy
as if this were not bad enough ,
but i would give myra breckinridge a 4/10
appears so hell-bent in turning her poorly-written part into something meaningful
has some funny momants ,
rex reed is not bad for a non-actor ,
but that is part of what makes it fun for those of us
i do not mind low budget movie with bad acting
this was intentional to make the women conspiracy seem more enjoyable and founded ,
but they were even worse .
and the unfunny sarcastic remark .
i did not find anything redeeming about this movie other than some of the attractive women.never have i felt
but sadly are never answered .
but this one is an undeniably excellent slice of british horror cinema .
whom horror fan will recognise as one of lee 's co-star in the greatest british horror film of all time ;
the same setting was used to great effect in the excellent 1966 horror film
and seeing him avoid an axe-wielding madman is a treat for the horror fan .
which is without doubt the best of the omnibus .
portrays his character with a great degree of sinisterness ;
the ending to this section is superbly played out ,
and this is a very solid horror film indeed .
reading the book is like watching a magnificent ballet with great music
while wearing a not-very-auspicious white japanese funeral shroud .
setting or even letting a fire eak out is worse than murder
moag house fire - great adjunct to a fight scene
that are not predictable and filled with overacting ,
this was the best muppet movie i have seen ever !
because that stupid nickelodeon show hey dude song still remains in my head .
my absolute favorite is the play at the end .
i proclaim this is the best movie
which was my favorite movie !
absolutely laughable film .
it is ridiculous .
and not have access to a mobile phone in this day and age ... the worst
not familiar with perhaps i could have enjoyed it through ignorance ,
possibly the most disappointing film i ever thought
in order to avoid the heat as well horde of coarse person
it is always a pleasure to watch a funny ,
that is perfect to allow one
dan in real life is definitely a solid
but this was by no means a bad thing .
this was actually more enjoyable than the overblown song and dance number we`ve
was by no means a bad presenter
were the award for best supporting actress and best supporting actor
cooper looked like he was having a great old time kidding his image.this is the oldest of clich\u00e9s
enjoyable
you are only presented with the best and most assured direction from each party.debating
it nearly becomes a pastiche of sin city \u0096 a refreshing eerie and visual turn in an otherwise fairly grounded film .
( portman - for once not annoying )
that it is insulting to international viewer .
that it is unavoidable to pick a favourite and a least favourite .
highly recommended both to mainstream of `` pretentious ''
enjoyable from beginning to end .
the acting was horrible
who leaves the perfect hollywood life
to pursue a not so subtle or perfect career .
the movie is well made and enjoyable
there are many wonderful aspect to this film ; however ,
good backdrop for solid story and some memorable line
simply is not good or funny enough .
original and funny moments.of course there also is very little story present and the movie nude east than script page .
and gets executed so poorly in the movie
and poorly done in the movie
the dubbing really was not all that bad though .
the voice stuck true to the dull
hitting a terrible low point .
this movie could be enjoyed by both male and female and by all age group .
and there is some great dialogue between gary cooper and jean arthur two very watchable star
i loved the story .
what great music on the soundtrack .
subtle depth
that is what was perfect about this film .
that again.beautiful film.i gave it an eight out of ten .
in what is arguably the best outdoor adventure film of all time ,
that makes this film so amazing.another strength
all convey an environmental message .
cinematography is excellent .
ned beatty is perfectly cast
if there is a weak link in the film ,
( and alberto tomba is absolutely the best ) ,
though it is by no mean weak overall .
helping the poor and from this set up spins a tale encompassing tragedy
it is a fairly predictable plot
while solid work comes also from rentar\u00f4 mikuni and an effectively baleful k\u00f4 nishimura
i enjoyed this one ,
and is not one of the best of the series
recommended for fan of the series ,
classy stuff though not a true great .
predictable plot
boring belushi
and possibly the worst kid actor of all time .
jim belushi should be ashamed to trade on the name of his wonderful
this is the best
the cast is excellent ,
the writing is great .
there is a favorite character for everyone
as most tv is awful .
and the winning show with great potential always get dumped right away .
it was so refreshing to have a new idea for a show
and then to hire excellent actor ,
the recent episode was the best one yet
and found the film pretty enjoyable
this will not be boring '' ,
making the ending a slight disappointment .
but it is probably a rare find in the united state .
casting is excellent
and the scenery was beautiful .
i recommend this funny ,
it is amazing that a motion picture
the 'modern ' segment is weakly written .
is poor science fiction at best .
mediocre acting bog down this film .
constantly slow and boring .
and the unintentional humour.the film opens with some truly bad and unconvincing gay banter between our go-lucky and happy character
and so bad
soon after this display of awful dialog-writing
we are witness to a spectacular and excellently shot hijack of an airplane .
but it is mindless fun at its best .
and fun ,
the script is this bad
the very enjoyable 'higher and higher '
is perhaps the least enjoyable song in this movie 's score ;
that this film gives us a rare chance to see her close-up ,
is also wasted.very well-represented here is dooley wilson ,
less enjoyable is mel odious
victor borge gives a rare film performance here ,
but it is an enjoyable delight ,
and i will rate it 8/10 .
it will be at a terrible price ,
and the great irony of the film is
it is greatly to the first-time feature director eric vallette 's credit
malefique benefit from excellent performance and
were all from `` planet earth '' .we were very very disappointed ,
is superb in giving instruction to kibbee ;
'' is the nearly perfect way
the greater the chance he
but everything about this waste of film is horrible .
the character are either unlikable or stupid ,
no matter how bad they are ,
but even ben and jack are used poorly ;
the two best performance by far are rachel weisz and chris walken .
and weisz is about the best actress in the business
and then goes to ridiculous length
the screenplay is painfully bad and the acting of the two lead poorly directed .
`` lame.compare this with documentary like `` the corporation '' or `` the fog of war ''
while npr 's liberal dogma strait-jacket its interviewee and dramatically limits its permitted message .
( featuring what some exploitation fan call the greatest gang rape on film of all time ) ,
sadly
the cast and crew took advantage of cheaper labor
( poor cheeta is left behind ) .
the talent involved lifted the overall product at least a little above the total mess
it is fun
legitimately funny .
roz kelly as tony 's lusty former flame
watching just for the subtle humour in insight into life and lifestyle almost forty year ago .
but unfortunately for them the script did not alow them
this film is awful .
except it is even more predictable and slow
i was extremely disappointed with this film .
fall into the film category of `` way too ridiculous in the dialogue and execution departmant
they are bad ,
what a waste of acting talent .
these actress are too good to have wasted their time on this crap .
beautiful scenery and costume can not keep this one alive .
it is political stance is wonderfully ambiguous .
( a great `` bicycle thief '' homage '' )
an enjoyable batman animated film .
but solid nonetheless .
the trend continues here.7.5/10
this show is one of the worst show of all time !
mad tv.it an hour of mad magazine joke witch are not funny to begin with ,
but you will have an enjoyable and entertaining time
by the end of the movie myia not only deflower but give poor innocent and naive trent a lesson
roy is either too drunk or stupid
to be intentionally or unintentionally funny
getting trent to drive her all over the north-east miya gets the poor slob drunk
but if you are not made of time to watch bad idea on screen
everyone in the cast is amazing from sutherland
this is nothing more than your typical girl-with-a-bad-childhood-obsessively-stalks-married-man film .
but it is a great story ,
where great i like this film
and they have greater muscle mass and upper torso strength .
this sexual bifurcation is the result of the perfectly normal process of natural selection .
she are not bad .
which it rarely does.this film lacks any meaning
the location is excellent
so unfortunately all
that goes to waste.it is nothing new .
another predictable modern 'horror ' ,
consistently does the stupid `` hey ,
it is boring and gets predictable .
avoid .
and made everyone look bad ,
anyone wanting to talk contact sevencard2003 on yahoo messenger.i admit
but lest not forget this gem
that is not so much incredible
( though for 1956 it does look quite amazing
perhaps the most unforgettable image for me is the monster realized on screen with the crew firing to no avail
that it looks out of fantasia.the acting from pidgeon is subtle :
but also excellent
helps with one of the funniest scene in the film with those gallon of bourbon robbie provides ) .
and when we are made to think about a horrible situation ,
i should have loved 1408 .
i walked out disappointed.this
because the premise of the movie puts cusack in the `` guy in a locked room '' scenario.this was not a bad movie ,
it was a muddied mess
that was fun
an incoherent mess with a gratingly deafening sound track
( the generic melissa sagemiller )
until we reach the predictable conclusion .
which i watch at least once a year - this movie is excellent in every aspect
the positive tone toward technology and progress is quite refreshing by today usually pessimistic standard - especially the finishing scene
and they made it even worst by pretending to be something else .
looking all weird and annoying .
after collaborating with many great director
he is not bad
lucy liu is dreadfully awful as violet .
her acting is a mess .
if forgettable motion picture
who fund the project
is one of the worst actor to ever appear on screen - and yes ,
you are the best . ''
that includes dysfunctional as one of the child .
the script is very strong with some excellent scene between husband and wife hoffman and tomei
and lumet is obviously having fun in directing a style he usually does not delve in .
this is a rare movie
brendan filone is the absolute best character in the sopranos .
brendan filone is the best character .
brendan filone is the best character on sopranos !
brendan filone is the best character ever .
and wants to see good death scene and great directing and producing ,
brendan filone is the best .
mister tom ' cliched and obvious and john thaw 's accent conjured up a picture of ronnie barker of the two ronny with a straw in his mouth doing his `country bumpkin ' accent.incidentally my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reason
anil kapoor and akshaye kumar ,
`` tashan '' has to be one of the worse film
the scenery is good and kareena kapoor
unfortunately
bad movie
one of the best
amazing book adaptation
in short - everything an excellent horror should be ... my favorite horror movie
this movie is absolutely horrible ,
which rarely happens to me .
are their worst characteristic .
that he is a bad actor ,
is truly laughable .
instead he bores us with interview throughout the movie like in a cheap tv show ,
comparing `` firepower '' to `` willpower '' at the end of the movie was one of the worst line i
this is one of my favorite film of all time .
the acting is fantastic
where everything is pulled together for a great ending .
and andrew davis does a great job
a not bad
but also not so great heist film .
he recruits circus gymnast giuliano gemma .
dougla and gemma soon find themselves pursued by mafia goon romano puppo as well as entangled in a really goofy love triangle with dougla 's infinitely patient girlfriend
and there is at least one excellent and creative car chase sequence
and the cinematography is by the great tonino delli colli ,
lazy and stupid .
it does not apply where the wife of the dictator desires to sleep with some stupid scrawny irresponsible white boy .
and there never was such a guy.gillian anderson looks incredible and sounds more british than most brit .
whitaker gives a great expansive magnetic performance
the `` man in white '' movie is definitely one of the funniest
if not the funniest ,
there are ton of funny gag and joke here ,
what dimwit from san francisco came up with this stupid plot ,
bad as korea
they were `` proxy war '' fought to keep the superpower from a direct engagement.this film makes me think
paul is true perfection
the movie is beautiful to watch .
it is too bad
the screenplay is not bad
gooding jr. is not bad
9/10
probably the perfect time
a very good companion piece to this excellent movie is `` white shadow in the south sea ''
why i was doing so..because the movie is so ridiculous and blah and poorly scripted
as any other lead.the song and dance routine are all perfection .
because of debbie reynold uplifting performance.full recommendation.8/10 star .
'arm and the man ' is one of shaw 's funniest play
and the whole play is generally a happy one.highly recommended .
not an awful film and hackman and washington are their usual illiant ,
but then you probably would not have a film.4/10
its richard gere and claire 's dane 's most important and best work .
and without charm.george sander was a superb character actor .
carole landis fare best .
they are stupid cartoonish idiot with annoying high pitched modulated voice .
the acting is terrible .
i really enjoyed this film .
strongly recommended
9/10 .
the costume design was great .
it is superbly acted with a wry sense of humor
highly recommended .
who is an excellent spanish talent
( something hard to find now day with all the bad novela over acting ) .
unfortunately ,
and took away many excellent scene ,
an excellent play
terrible .
this was a real waste of money
this is not among jimmy stewart 's best film
who was not about to waste the star in a third-rate flick .
it is worth seeing but not especially great .
but it is not recommended
the ending was not predictable ,
being too simple or too boring .
what a great barbara stanwyck film
`` jeopardy '' was fantastic .
this was horrible .
there is bad ,
in which john heard did a fantastic job .
heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time ,
too bad .
and hire him as lead bad guy again ,
and in fact the entire cast are totally wasted .
lame joke abound ,
avoid this and seek out one of `` lampoon 's '' truly funny film like `` national lampoon 's golddigger '' - merk
this is widely viewed in australia as one of the best cop dramas ever produced here ... and for my money
the best scene is a graphic oom handle masturbation
this movie is a boring
amateurish mess
and the production is amazingly sloppy .
this movie would have no redeeming quality at all .
movie with terrible computer generated
and absolute waste of time ,
but ... wow ... this was bad .
king gives the best performance of the film .
as well there are some fascinating smaller part
somewhat dull person ,
egon is 'the ' dull intellectual ,
the adaptation excel in its beautiful cinematography
they are so predictable
that it becomes annoying .
bbs delivers a solid
enjoyable
i always loved elvira 's tv show
this sort of mythic character belong to whoever does it best ;
and cassandra peterson does it best .
was also excellent .
he exudes a wonderful refined malice .
they were met with cheer and thank from the now gay man of the planet.subtle ,
it may not be the absolute worst thing
certainly not horrible
the beloved country
the beloved country seems to have no idea
( except that i did enjoy the novel more than i enjoyed the film )
it was not that bad
( but that can be blamed on he screenwriter
the painfully misplaced and boringly pastoral orchestra track really help with this dulling down of the film .
with many rather good or great shot
it is too bad
lamented 1960s series with mike pratt and kenneth cope ,
and did little to mask the poor quality of the script and dialogue .
and less than subtle tension between the two living lead . )
and here i was not disappointed .
i was sadly disappointed .
i found the joke predictable
this was actually my favorite series of scooby doo
some of the best episode were `` i left my neck in san francisco '' ,
the story itself is not too bad ,
you want to see a *good* environmental-message movie with no plot ,
but it all fails miserably to create any meaningful connection with the audience .
i gave lady a 5/10 ,
4/10
montand must absolutely find the killer ... and what a great ending !
highly recommended .
and loved actor - her portrayal of a lonely ,
79/100 .
worst dcom i have seen .
this was just bad .
who is a very funny actress
and that one fight scene.4/10
it is not funny .
it is not even remotely funny .
smiling at the camera like it is the funniest thing ever written .
talking in a very effeminate way about his dull life as a temp .
it is just unfunny humor .
does not make a great movie.this is an obvious attempt
this movie is just plain bad .
it is not even worth watching to make fun of it .
the lunatic professor is just plain annoying .
( which i glady do for the sake of good bad movie )
and allowing for exceedingly stupid victim in a horror movie ,
if you are looking for a good-bad movie ,
if you want to simply waste your time on an annoying bad movie
great camera work and lighting technique .
this movie is excellent .
the acting was also great
since the cast is a gathering of great genre veteran
the film opens with its absolute greatest and most hauntingly memorable sequence ,
though sadly enough they are the only one
to be so boring and uneventful .
a lot of movie-material is wasted on crew member putting film spool in the camera and dragging around cable or \u0096 even worse \u0096 faith domergue and charle macaulay portraying horridly intolerable actor stereotype .
confirming `` house of seven corpse '' is a pretty dreadful movie .
numerous low-budgeted 70 's gem were stunningly gross ,
christopher smith has certainly done a great job with the visual aspect of the film .
the story is rather weak ,
it was a fun ride .
i simpley adore the movie and the cast ... i would give each actor an oscar ... great
great movie ... i
and did not loved it ... also ,
glenn close was fantastic ...
the story was beautiful and sad at the same time ... i loved the fact
but in a moment of absolute weakness
-- or maybe i should say for his horrible acting .
just awful .
to how bad this flick
unfortunately
the script is bad ! ! !
shade is a waste of your time .
the combination of the superb black and white photography and the 'eugene onegin with a twist ' plot made this a real knock out for me .
there was a superb moment
that often the story is less important than imagery and atmosphere - last year in marienbad is a good example of such a film .
regardless of what personal opinion one may have of walerian borowczyk grotesque yet beautiful gem `` la b\u00eate '' of 1975 ,
that this bizarre gem is an absolutely unique cinematic experience .
why this controversial gem fell victim to stuporous film censor .
the young and beautiful daughter of a wealthy english family .
`` la b\u00eate '' is doubtlessly also stunningly beautiful in style
and the beautiful score and incredible cinematography build an overwhelming atmosphere for this grotesque tale .
the entire cast of `` la b\u00eate '' is fantastic
the film profit from an exceptionally beautiful cast ,
( who sadly died of aid in 1999 )
but very highly recommended to fan of controversial and unusual cinema .
a true cult gem !
who in their right mind does anything so stupid as this movie ?
please ... .hypothermic weak thug ... acting from hell ... stylistically this movie shifts between teen comedy
and it is an insult to any thinking person .
walk away it is more horrible
shoot 'em up was fun and funny ,
this is just pathetic and terrible .
talk about bad taste .
sammo copy bruce lee 's fighting move perfectly .
5/10 star .
this had to be one of the most god awful wrestlemania ever
but i enjoyed.but nope
altered is a waste of time ,
with bad
and even worse acting .
there are not many redeeming factor ,
coupled with some cheap scare tactic employed.what is good
there are the usual cheap special effect
this one is less fun ,
one of the main character does something really stupid
for me it is a great turn-off.the reason
and i really enjoyed the performance of all the actor .
i really enjoyed this movie
and i give it a 7.5/10
this film was not only one of john ford 's own personal favorite but also numbered director sergei m. eisenstein and bertrand tavernier among its high-profile admirer .
a beautifully made and pictorially quite poetic piece of work
a superb but perhaps little-known gem
try to see this movie on the largest tv possible and a great sound system .
the more i like it.it is definitely one of renny harlin 's best movie .
the special effect are great and spectacular .
and it poorly resembles
( marvelously played by the beautiful rebecca brooke ) ,
constantly eating best gal pal anna
( a superbly moving performance by the lovely jennifer welle )
with excellent support from edward
but never raunchy or tedious .
melodic acoustic folk score are both on the money solid and effective .
recommended viewing for sarno fan .
i still enjoyed it
and loved it ,
was so funny and i adored the cast ,
and were just fantastic ,
that was just fantastic ,
i loved them
she was as bland
it felt like a based-on-real-life scenario in the absolute worst sense :
90 % of daily life is boring ,
excellent film dealing with the life of an old man
earnest message to the converted
unfortunately
that is the disappointment.we get little more than the formulaic element of such film but with slow pacing
too bad more time
sadly
this drearily disappointing film only gets a 4 .
why at the end.highly recommended .
it was a great film
that the ending is sort of disappointing .
i would have loved it to turn out a little different !
and loved it .
still find it a great vietnam movie .
excellent film .
and colorful.election is well made in the enjoyable
in a great performance
where harron recreates betty 's bondage photography session are fascinating and adroitly executed .
errol flynn had one of his favorite role as the ash aggart from a fighting irish family
both flynn and ward bond give what is probably among the best performance
although it is too bad warner did not have more faith in flynn
out.the fighting scene are among the best ever choreographed for the screen
thre is not a single scorsese movie i would place on a list of my favorite movie .
but this is the best thing
scorsese 's patient elucidation of favorite film moment ,
that were popular favorite .
what idea are being explored in their favorite movie .
scorsese is best
this is the best mob film ever made .
this film could have easily been nominated for best picture
hank gives one of his best performance ,
but besides the incredible performance ,
this was by far the best score of the year .
this is a great film
did it wonderfully.charis character
the frustrating part is that it is 1/3 of a great film .
that the film degenerates into an almost unwatchable mess
oh god where to begin ... ... bad acting ... .character you just do not care about ...
rubbish film waste of \u00a32.30 from my local liary ...
edward furlong and christina ricci are an excellent couple
that features a rare situation
it may seem boring or pretentious for some person
that the `` full of grace '' line are really annoying .
this is a total waste of money .
the special effect are terrible .
is my all time favorite .
it could not be that bad
with that ridiculous hairdo and costume .
and it is funny to see eva larue callahan
like everything else in this mess
it is just bad .
`` chinese ghost story '' is one of the most amazing hong kong film i
horror and martial arts.the film has some wonderful visual and amazing fights.i love especially the fight scene between wu ma and the tree demon tongue.truly original and refreshing film and another embalmer 's fine recommendation .
the plot was bad ? )
but she is just stupid like that .
it is a poor example of independent filmography .
most would agree is very naturally boring .
it is not that fem is downright bad ,
it is rather that it is just downright ... mediocre .
if you have got time to waste
that you have missed some great
it is enjoyable and fast-paced .
as being a naive young country boy.while his was the best performance ,
( an amazingly incovenient title )
is simply a bad movie ;
but the result is that the whole thing is shot in an annoying soft focus .
simply terrible .
with great actor ,
( star war - episode i is my best example )
i loved the first three sw movie ,
episode i was weak in comparison .
`` this is almost too beautiful . ''
each of them perfect in every detail .
beautiful .
i enjoyed every minute of it .
this movie was 100 % boring ,
it was not funny and didnt really hve
it was boring and i hope whoever out there
aside from that this is fun .
i have read some terrible thing about this film ,
so i was prepared for the worst .
a little ambition is not a bad thing .
great fight between peter and the naked devil
some great
( aline mess ) ,
that his film almost invariably end up as a tangled mess
bruce is excellent in this film ,
8/10 .
and shows then avoid this movie at all cost .
it was at best
stupid ,
and at worst ... well ... really stupid .
just a lame attempt to be shocking .
`` intensive care '' was quite bad and very unintentionally funny .
but at least not as bad as i thought
but never a good shocker.spoiler aheadthe fun lies in ridiculous moment .
very funny if you are dutch
it is terrible to the point
how bad a film can get !
he was right.normally with a film this dreadful i
as it will put every other bad film
made a great god .
what all of these beautiful woman saw in him .
her were absolutely outrageous and ridiculous .
stupid thing
his character was bland and boring.gina gershon 's character was unnecessarily british .
horrible acting
what a mess of a movie .
but the one and only redeeming quality this movie has is that curley is in it .
( and larry 's not bad either ) .
the best thing
the first vampire was fun ,
( the poor man 's kevin bacon )
he picks up some lame `` hunter '' along the way
( including an annoyingly feminist infected girl
and done much better.john carpenter has been responsible for a lot of bad movie lately .
right up until the unbelievably cheap
and now this waste of celluloid .
where are more great like assault on precinct 13
the menu looks awful.by comparison
the performance in this movie were fantastic .
the dialogue was great .
jason patric delivered a fantastic performance as `` kid '' collin in this wonderful adaptation of the jim thompson novel .
this film really stayed true to the pulp fiction/film noir root from
i recommend this movie to all film noir fan .
enjoyed this 1936 film with plenty of veteran classic actor and especially
`` king kong '' gave a great supporting role as a bookie along with jame gleason
this was great entertainment
his scene were very funny in a buster keaton-like performance .
solid directing and nice cinematography .
but only at how pathetic the whole set-up is .
this is actually one of my favorite film ,
there is some great acting in it and it shows
made me feel bad .
but this poor excuse for a soft-core porno flick is needlessly offensive ,
lacks anything resembling wit ,
at best
worst
special effect are pretty bad ...
and it is laughable at best.the film does have a couple ight spot ...
it has the same weak production value ,
where the sidewalk ends is quite a good film-noir crime drama
and blames it on another person
excellent.rating :
wonderful actor are replete throughout the whole movie
in real life she greatly admired ,
and so warm and enjoyable to behold .
i whole heartily give miss sullivan a perfect 10 in this golden age cinema classic ,
unfortunately
unfortunately
this one is simply stupid and not very funny at all .
it is one of his poorest role .
sadly
it is the best part of the movie ...
but weak and gullible argument .
this has to be the worst piece of monkey s @ #
was horrible !
( great movie ) .
the fighting and action sequence were pi $ $ poor.bottom line :
unfortunately
( modeled on the great pyramid of khufu ,
would not a floating futuristic pyramid be in perfect condition ? ) .
it does not help that the animation are poor
this is perhaps the best rockumentary ever- a british ,
the plot is great ,
and you can genuinely empathise with some of the events- such as ray 's problem with fitting in the band.the soundtrack is excellent .
and has some genuinely funny section in it .
this documentary on schlockmeister william castle takes a few cheap shot at the naive '50s-'60s environment
-- look at the funny
who looks great ,
best of the best etc ) .
what \u0096 the result is predictable but ultimately satisfying.the fact
may be disappointed \u0096 taekwondo does not deliver the usual flurry of move and acrobatic
this is arguably the worst movie i have ever seen.i get
only running with scissors was even more dysfunctional and less funny.i will never get those hour back .
one of the best movie out there .
yeah maybe the cinematography was not the greatest
but an excellent plot and concept .
great for the time and illiant and creative idea .
the actor gave a great performance
the set are not amazing ,
it is a great view and very fun .
the script was poorly written
barring any spoiler i have seen the worse of bad movie
and even they did not end this poorly .
bad acting and ending though ...
who was one of italy 's most ambitious and creative but sadly underrated film maker .
that `` miami golem '' is a lost and undeservedly obscure gem of italian exploitation cinema .
this is a pretty bad movie !
the acting performance are painfully awful .
there is the unforgettable scene
of that were sadly overlooked at the time and unfortunately
-- not great
but not nearly as bad
alexandra staden as modesty is stunningly beautiful and an excellent choice .
.the van was a perfect example of crown 's hit strategy
a perfect ad line for the film ! there are the usual assortment of `` good '' and `` bad '' girl
red rock west is one of those tight noir thriller
the best performance was by the late j.t .
walsh was a great character actor
but this was a waste of time
predictable .
framed in rather dull and meaningless scenario .
i really enjoyed this movie .
most of the review have been bad ,
but the rest is just clean fun and very entertaining .
emma robert is a beautiful young lady
emma was so much fun to watch in the role of nancy drew .
unfortunately
has been made completely pointless
silly and equally pointless plot and an inadequate
and his supporting cast are hardly trying their best .
and merely just qualify as boring
inept and terribly bad .
and the set piece look cheap enough to be creepy .
and still it is the best aspect about the entire movie .
johnny dangerously is one of the funniest movie
some of the funny bit are done in passing
it is one of those rare movie
( fast time at ridgemont high
is excellent .
highly recommended .
of course my favorite character was the grandmother
seeing the awful thing child
they saw thing child should not see.paul lukas ... dear paul did an amazing job ! ! !
that he go the oscar and bogie did not but hey they both did amazing job so i think
but lukas ' performance was so amazing
( good or bad )
and from extremely bad writing and direction by vic morrow.of the last 30 older movie
and decide to call it the worst movie ever made .
i have seen a movie so horrible
that i wanted to write about how bad it was
before it was even over.i love bad movie .
jeeper creeper and most horrible horror movie were good .
if someone reading my review wastes their money
are bad.the acting is bad.the two lead are attractive ,
before they waste a dime on it .
i will tell you anything.i love bad movie
but this may be the number 1 most worthless and stupid and dumbass movie ever made.and
that is genuinely funny at every single moment
sometimes subtle
sometimes loud and sometimes stupid but overall ,
who is giving us a gruelingly boring play-by-play
embarrassly bad script and amateur writing
how did they attract such great talent to this clunker ?
the directing is equally bad !
the most badly directed scene however
the most ridiculous bit of writing ,
if the poor kid had any acting skill ,
she is still young and beautiful ,
because the direction and writing were obviously awful
but what lifts this movie to a height rarely realized is its focus on the little incidence in our life
casting and direction are superb .
9/10 .
who called this `` plotless and pointless ''
prospective renter of this mess would do well
the effect are cheap ,
and worse - pointless.the script seems to have been written by a first year film student
the acting is simply undescribably bad - tilda swinton caps a career
which veers neurotically between comotose and laughable 'intensity ' .
it i realized what a funny man he is .
he poked fun at almost every key historic event
this documentary/comedy was a great satire
is really true.i enjoyed
directed by frank r. strayer the vampire bat was a cheapie from majestic picture to cash in on the success
and quite frankly it is rather dull .
boring .
you are pathetic ,
as cinema has moved on a lot since 1933 and a bland
dull
boring and misleading film such as the vampire bat just does not cut it these day ,
and the veteran cast chasing bourne is superb with a nice part by albert finney .
all in all this is the best of the trilogy conclusion this year ,
if not the best action trilogy ever .
i love zombie film and even bad one usually have something going for them but not this atrocity .
because it is so insultingly poor ,
the whole thing is one pointless mess ,
and without doubt the worst movie of all time.honetly
the very worst movie of all time .
that the only positive review give this a 10/10 and urge you
it is terrible.0/10
that characterized the 70s era.overall this is a very funny sitcom .
while married with child is a great sitcom in its own right ,
i was to be disappointed ,
it got worse
they had an excellent opportunity
to make a great franchise of film here ,
they have totally wasted that opportunity .
i was disappointed would be something of an understatement .
kundry is portrayed as a sort of beautiful but corrupt mary magdalene or eve from genesis
but beautifully sung by mezzo-soprano yvonne minton ) .
but it lacks the depth and overall greatness of the greater parsifal of the stage - jame king
..it is still an enjoyable
brenda blethyn nominated for best actress in a leading role ? ?
nominated for best picture ? ?
but this movie might very well be the worst movie of all time
the writing and acting were both horrible .
blethyn 's perfomance in particular was one of the worst i
awful movie
lost is not the greatest tv show in history ,
further acknowledgement should also go out to a pounding soundtrack
it was god-awful.i was watching my local sci-fi station last night ,
movie so bad ,
about this movie is thoroughly horrible with two exception
in term of being horrible ) .
the acting is horrible all around ,
the dialog is horrible
live melting man - incredible
it is not the worst of the worst
but it is pretty freaking bad .
i thoroughly enjoyed this film for its humor and pathos .
like these anyone would feel nurtured and loved .
that i have immensely enjoyed in my lifetime ,
that even the passage of time has not in the least dulled the shine of this film.the story is about a teenaged girl
the viewing is at once fascinating and compelling - though
is quite superb.the film move at a nice pace ,
not the worse
the flimsy script was poorly thought-out
knocking off these wannabe punk one by one became ridiculous
because of the stupidity of the lead up .
to dispatch the next thug her choice were quite disappointing .
you could see mile ahead.susan montford 's soberly slick direction lacks cohesion and energy ,
and polished photography.no great shake .
that is rarely talked about .
the film also has some amazing costume .
erendira is an amazing film ,
excellente !
flynn is well suited to the role of suave but unpredictable corbett .
but his honesty and sportsmanship gives a certain contrast to the main character.there is action and excitement aplenty and a wonderful ending with the requisite redemption for all .
there is something about beautiful inside and out
the marketing person in hollywood must have dictated the multiple bad guy
who are working on their 2nd or 3rd project.do not waste your time
they are funny and enjoyable .
when i saw a name of this title and genre i thought great ,
all the acting is awful - even from veteran willem dafoe .
that makes such great film
and he didnt want it back its so bad .
sadly
beautiful film noir
it is not a bad story
even if it is not perfect .
the president was going to immediately change all us foreign policy.the worst thing is that ,
you might have serious issues.beside the wonderful script i
also noticed the great chemistry between actor deborah kara unger and matthew modine -
( playing a hilariously bad actress )
yet funny performance.great film
but this just makes it worse .
the best part of the movie ,
this is one of the funniest shit i
though hahahaha.yeah this movie actually is the worse ,
poor dialog and acting .
i loved the show so much ! finally a show
but just not funny enough .
that were just plain stupid ,
it was the best show ever made and i am very sorry
but with all the trapping of a typical lame '70 's sit-com show complete with obtrusive laugh track
this was possibly the worst thing
please do not waste +/- 2 hour of your life
please do not waste +/- 2 hour of your life
during the cheap filmed in video beginning of crazy fat ethel ii
unfortunately
if this all sounds like fun ,
this film was poorly made with cheap effect and even worse acting .
to make matter worse ,
a very poor effort .
and it is the best hamlet ,
and maybe the best shakespeare
is great ,
this was my favorite performance of the year by far .
branagh avoids the melodrama
he was the weakest member of the cast .
but he was his usual funny self
as a pok\u00e9mon fan i enjoyed this movie very much .
but that can be somewhat unavoidable
the animation was beautiful ,
if it offends your socially engineered sensibility then go back to the comfort of your meryl steep collection.boring
tedious
and very tiresome waste of celluloid-particularly in light of coburn/hackman/bergen 's presence .
without the constant diversion of the out-of-place mexican guy with the bad tooth .
saw this in preview- great movie- wonderful characterizations- witty and intelligent dialog- actor were fantastic- peter falk will be up for an oscar- paul reiser was charming- photography was marvelous reiser was at the theater
who is longing to see intelligent drama and wonderful performance
i have always enjoyed seeing chuck norri in film .
although the acting may not be superb ,
the fight scene are fantastic .
i also enjoyed seeing
very bad
the premise seemed enjoyable :
this was disappointing .
it is a superb production in almost all aspect .
max invites his stupid acquaintance piece
jamie and piece.the low budget `` spanish judge '' is a movie with a reasonable screenplay with an awful conclusion
that wastes a good cast .
valeria golino is astonishingly beautiful
they are not able to save the stupid story .
that are supposed to be funny
unfortunately do not work ,
and actually they are silly and not funny .
this movie is the best movie
it is just great everyone should watch it
and the actor are great the location is rome italy thats the best place ever
the actor are great mary-kate olsen is such a great actress
she plays charlie and thats a great character and ashley olsen play leila and thats a great character to love
with terrible reception
making a great deal of money
and sleeping with a great many woman .
this was the worst film
flat and absolutely not funny .
watching a cheap soft porno
would possibly be greater
than watching this film.this film seems to be a very bad made sex ad ,
great gp spinning like a wheel in his grave
then i doubt anything will.the excellent review above 'not a film for parson fan ' sum up most of my feeling .
what i got was poorly executed slapstick with no clich\u00e9 left unturned .
stupid hippy ?
stupid fat cop ?
awful plot contrivance ?
that watching this was like watching a bad episode of quincy
that is how bad the direction was .
terrible jump cut ,
awful camera work ,
who 's most noteworthy recent work is a really lousy bbc sunday night drama
if he is not so bad ,
and was jaw droppingly unfunny from beginning to ... oh wait ,
then a loincloth is pretty boring
a perfectly hideous 80s-touch
who also plays a bad
a bad guy .
( beloved )
so for me this movie just fails
it is still one of the worst movie i have ever seen.here is the plot ,
but it is truly an awful movie .
they both were excellent
aside from the great movie metropolis ,
it is a great film for two reason .
to create amazing scene of both a post-apocalyptic world and a vast city of tomorrow .
`` are person really that stupid or are we destined for greatness ? ''
and ended up with an incoherent mess.it
i rated it a 1/10
but i found the `` story '' part of the movie with matlin in it annoying
non-related and downright stupid .
that bit about the polish wedding with that dance was not in the least bit funny .
it was laughable
and stupid .
the world 's worst was hendrix !
poorly acted piece of clap-trap .
it has a really stupid `` plot
really pathetic `` acting
the whole thing is so boring !
the creature itself is rarely seen throughout most of the movie .
always enjoy the great acting talent of harry hamlin ,
to find some lost gem and uncomprehended masterpiece ,
but i did not see anything of the sort in this pastel-coloured mess .
i have not really watched many bad film before ,
this is what is called `` so bad
probably because it is so unintentionally damn funny !
there is not exactly bad acting from everyone
involved in that hot mess of a movie
geoffrey lewis looks completely pathetic as frank ,
which is an utterly stupid character .
but the movie was mostly very bad and the sad part is
most sequel of this sort are pretty lame - pale imitation of the original ,
i should pick a cheap scenario ,
one of the worst i have even seen
go check out some poster do not waste your time
some of the worst
lame dialog
add to that the cheap production value and you have got a movie
but this is nearly unwatchably bad.plot-wise ,
it is a dreadful
that combines these three would be at least enjoyable .
was completely uninspired and lacks imagination -
the dialogue and acting are even worse than in an average porno movie .
especially thomas kretschmann gives new meaning to the term 'bad performance ' .
bad acting would not have been such a huge problem
since he fails on all possible account as a director .
worst of all is the terrible digital animation ,
since they will no doubt take gruesome revenge on him for the ridiculous way
it is a great deal of fun .
wonderfully atmospheric .
but it is a great vehicle for him ,
that made great wartime fare .
it would have been wonderful to have seen this film
george wendt is very poor in his supporting role .
this is quite enjoyable time capsule .
plot is laughable ,
but this television pilot delivers a great springboard
either.stargate sg1 is currently one of my favorite program .
and that they based their screenplay on another poorly written screenplay
if the casting was a bad joke
then the direction and acting were the poorly- delivered punch line .
it could not have made thing much worse really .
unfortunately
that serling would build up sympathy for his character before messing them over .
none of the character are particularly sympathetic or interesting until the last segment.framing story :
but he rarely does .
most of the actor are not too bad
not a bad little piece
why do person end up in cold storage in silver lame suit ?
the acting and plot are amazing .
so that his wife can keep looking beautiful .
lugosi is great here ,
a fun little view .
i wasted my money on this when i could have given it to a homeless person or a busker or something
it is far from her best .
it is not one of her worst
and fun filled time .
and set to a superb soundtrack
the cast are largely awful
here she looks great naked
utterly rubbish movie with lovell and soundtrack the only real redeeming feature .
the movie was going to be bad .
the movie was a dumbed down tarted up version of the tv show.jessica simpson was pathetic .
jessica simpson 's interpretation of daisy was simply awful .
as well.do not waste your money .
and true duke fan like me and my three kid are you will be very disappointed .
brosnan is wonderfully crass and crude as the anti-hero and kinnear delightful as his counterpart
great story and a great cast and nothing else to weigh it down .
jack grinnage and ruth mcdevitt give mcgavin the kind of solid support
some excellent guest star add colour and verve to individual episode - erik estrada in legacy of terror
is a great suspense movie
the whole storyline is great and i thought
and supposedly the best adaptation of his work since the original `` hellraiser ''
is exclusively meant to shock and to repulse the viewer with weak nerve system
some even bigger than the pointless gore ,
unfortunately the pacing is very uneven
and the elaboration of the potentially fantastic plot is made unnecessarily convoluted .
she is a very beautiful woman
otherwise it is run of the mill and forgettable .
i had just stayed in the bar.the film is quite frankly boring .
it was boring already ?
surprisingly
pure science fiction.the best way plausibly to realize the plot 's `` what if '' is through the science fiction genre .
forbidden planet remains the greatest of all science fiction film .
is fascinating as film noir with capable performance from a strong supporting cast .
a good entry in the field of noir
blanding builds his dream house still works well as comedy
that this is so terrible
but because the plot was just pathetic .
utterly tedious.you sat right till the end hoping for a twist -
and got nothing but a huge sense of disappointment .
hides the body and then plant subtle clue .
it was a complete waste of time .
was ridiculous
and altogether-just lame .
it is that bad.i heard it
who got stuck with the great depression
not the usual movie escapist fare for those trying to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainmant .
it is a beautifully paced nail-biter about a plot
that hollywood rarely uses
but it captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated baltic state beautifully
this heist film starts from a great script ,
is bad ,
it is obvious that rko tried to make a great farewell for weissmuller ,
shooting in beautiful scenery in m\u00e9xico
but the worst character is benji
an obnoxious mailman
boring and decidedly of dubious taste ,
and has a few great scene :
its unfortunate that someone decided to spin off on the best horror movie of all time in my book .
this poor copy steal lot of material from the first three film going as far as even copying how person die and what will happen in the future to the key character
and it basically tries to cram in three film into one and fails .
it fails even to create a good scary atmosphere for one
because it was the only way for them too cope with the horror around them.this movie unfortunately misses
unfortunately this movie ignored these factor ,
but was robbed of this potential thank to a terrible script and some bad acting ,
not to mention the strangely annoying and unnecessary george clooney character and the guy
the plot is boring ,
personally i found her rather annoying .
and the comedy-part is not funny at all ,
it is just a cheap try
it is funny for preadolescent 12-13 year old
the humor is weak except for some shots.dope ?
i will give it 4/10 star ,
because marco rima is quite funny during his screen time .
ever have gotten funding ,
it is a complete waste of your time .
this one is a cross between his very funny side
she is more than just a couple of nice tit and great ass .
his limited scene are very funny
funny script ,
the acting is weak
worst film ever
that there is nothing worse in the movie world.i envy these person ,
there are film out there so bad
so unintentionally hilarious and so ridiculous
that cults form around them to celeate their awfulness and their discussion board are the kindest place on the internet due to everyone agreeing unanimously
film is really that bad.lady and gentleman
that is so utterly bad
it is awful
this film is legendarily terrible .
just how catastrophic his bastard creation really is.everything in this film fails on an epic level ,
the acting is the worst
the plot is the most ridiculous ,
that this film is really as bad
and the character are even worse .
so i will give you two tame mild example of how stupid this film is
certain you will not find any palm tree there.imagine this kind of stupid amateur inconsistency stretched
combined with ridiculous dialogue and plot and then multiply it by 10
imagine the absolute worst film you have seen in your life
and imagine it being even worse
how amateur could be as much of a suck fest as this.the real worst movie of all time
that are perfect ten .
house of game is not just a superb film
but is the best movie about con artist i have ever seen-bar none .
as margaret ford is simply perfection
joe mantegna was also wonderful .
i also loved the way
it fit perfectly
and loved
it is a great character study
( although not my absolute favorite film
it does rank as one of the best character study
and contains some of the best `` twist '' i have ever seen as well .
taking on venomous serpent and evildoer in the america of 1936 or the jungle of south america in a series of fantastic cliffhanging adventure .
perhaps the best
of legendary producer george pal 's final film is that his often beautifully
designed but sadly flat adaptation of kenneth robeson 's pulp-paperback novel probably had george luca and phil kaufman leaving the theatre
a rather dull charlton heston clone here ) ,
though with the exception of paul gleason they are all so horribly badly cast and overplayed
delivering one of cinema 's worst accent
unfortunately it is a question of tone :
but were treated as somewhat comical figure of low-budget camp fun with action scene quickly knocked off on the cheap almost as an afterthought ,
the funniest moment are usually purely unintentional
be it chasing a native assassin on the rooftop of new york skyscraper or escaping from a yacht full of bad guy .
i heard horrible thing ,
but i find the goofy dialogue quite enjoyable .
my favorite zombie was the machete-wielding maniac at the gas station .
trying to kill a girl.favorite quote \u0096
this has to be one of the worst movie i
it is the best film i have seen all year
this film was beautifully directed
and an inspiring message .
( in one wonderful bit
with not a minute wasted .
the final battle between good and bad other
billed as `` the world 's funniest human '' in this dull little cartoon .
death lends a hand is frankly kind of a boring columbo to me .
but the story was weaker in this episode than in the other .
that the movie is in fact boring .
but believe me to watch it for 2 hour is not fun at all .
and it may be more out of despair and disbelieve than out of fun .
and they are trying to be funny so hard
that should not be boring .
the film is almost laughable with debbie reynold and shelley winter teaming up as the mother of convicted murderer .
to make matter worse
for it is soooo predictable )
the wonderful special effect
that actually delivers some great scare !
the audience loved it ...
and my wife and i loved it !
but you would not know it ... the film looks fantastic ...
and the scare are great !
wish the rest of it were that inventive-and funny .
it is a great film
this is the most cliche ridden and worst romantic comedy i
every scene is cringe worthy and the two lead actor - corey and danny are soo annoying .
and the killer from urban legend are the only redeeming quality in this poor attempt of a film .
1/10 avoid
it was a great discussion starter in my class .
the first 2/3 are dull ,
though it is hard to blame the actor alone :
unfortunately ,
this film is bad by cinema standard and mediocre by tv standard
i have some excellent suggestion :
superb film ) ,
that her talent is apparent and her performance excellent .
and that is where this movie fails.by the halfway point ,
it is bland
boring
that the cinematography and sound quality are comparable to your neighbor 's bad home movie .
this movie is very very very poor .
it was a bit funny
and it got to boring through out the movie .
it is not worth it.do not waste time on even thinking to do something with this movie
that inspired the excellent martin scorsese .
very enjoyable despite being a bit long ,
i found this to be one of the best documentary on film yet .
the flaw will only be all the more obvious.from one of the lamest meet cute sequence i can recall seeing
there are a sprinkling of instantly forgettable musical number
miss garland was wonderful in a number of musical film ,
why they called it 'the lubitsch touch ' and not the 'robert z. leonard touch'.avoid this and rewatch either the original film or one of judy garland 's earlier film
and most of the `` funny '' moment of this film play off of this .
it is not even funny.i just could not suspend disbelief and i could not finish the movie .
and must avoid strip club .
and i really enjoyed it.i found
his best performance is still in `` killer tongue
`` night terror '' is not perfect ,
one thousand sunrise will be watched by 90 % of human on this planet ... .our day are limited ... excellent movie for all woman ... . maker of human body ... thank and regard .
it is very disappointing
as well.tom beringer was not too bad
no worse than usual ;
who sat through this mess ,
there were some exceptionally funny line ,
as could be done given the rather disappointing script writing .
but it lacks the necessary quality
smart entertaining movie with solid performance throughout .
it has of course another solid performance from warren beatty ,
madonna was great as the damsel in distress ,
to watch a fun
smart movie with great acting and a solid script
you will be disappointed .
that with ridiculous exposition about deadly siren .
that boarder on pleasurable and are a great improvement on his previous film
which is one of the worst film i
the worst thing about this movie are not to be found in the body of the film ,
it is ultimately a mildly diverting if pointless movie
that just slips right into the canon of bad horror movie
that digital is often synonymous with cheapness and ease of use .
the best moment of the conversation comes
but redundant.the best moment is reserved for robert 's comment about person
i was slightly disappointed
that forest is `` the best british film in year '' .
`` this is not amazing
as is simply one of the best australian film ever made .
it fully deserved to win best picture .
who is demonstrating great skill and incredible sensitivity .
unfortunately in australia at the time ss was released the push was ,
unfortunately for me ss is a film about nothing ,
it is a complete waste .
2/10
way too predictable of a story line with potential
to be funny
make it for a great film
i give this movie 7/10
this movie just continues that bad tradition .
which would not be so bad in one movie
i asked the clerk what the worst movie
for free ... this movie is terrible .
god-awful even .
the acting was terrible .
but the stupidity of the main character was exhausting .
but it is so bad
that it is not even funny in that way .
avoid !
this was the worst movie i have ever seen ,
yet it was also the best movie .
sci fi original movie 's are supposed to be bad ,
that is what makes them fun !
is probably the best quote ever !
best idea ever !
guns dinosaur medieval time space travel terrible actingso go watch this movie ,
i did not give this movie a perfect score
in order to be honest in comparing to great classic like `` citizen kane '' and `` seven samaurai . ''
this movie is so all-around wonderful ,
it scores so poorly for the general imdb voter .
that is neither insulting nor boring for either
`` paulie '' is a perfect candidate .
this is one of the very worst film clark gable made .
only parnell was obviously worse .
and the dialog is so lousy
`` the star are at their best here '' .
best at producing unintended chuckle ?
( especially the ridiculous ending ) ,
harlow 's character was amazingly stupid
it was all clich\u00e9s until the final ridiculous marriage scene occurred .
it might just be the worst gable film .
beautiful thing excluded
called this film `` ... shimmeringly beautiful and utterly real . ''
as this is truly far from beautiful .
sadly
this is the best emma in existence in my opinion .
it is one of the worst film i
but the plot is totally ridiculous .
the whole plot is entirely too weak for my taste and i was extremely disappointed .
who enjoyed this piece of crap ,
it is not funny ,
am deeply sorry i wasted an hour and a half watching the mess .
1/10 .
with an excellent background .
the best thing on this movie is ,
the plot is inane and laughable
everything about the technical side of this film is either mediocre or just plain awful .
the venerable brando could not take focus away from the awful rags
called `` david lynch-esquire '' and `` irreverently funny '' ...
and do not confuse irreverence with stupidity .
this is a wonderful film .
joan blondell and jame cagney are incredible together .
the movie is fascinating in and of itself .
sam neill is perfect as michael chamberlain ,
( streep 's for best actress . )
it tells a great story
and you get great performance from the entire cast .
( the term actor would be an insult for all other actor )
it is so ridiculous ,
but was so disappointed about this particular film .
ridiculous ending and difficult to follow story line .
the only redeeming quality of the film was the soundtrack .
but a stunning tribute to french actor and their cinema.supported by a solid reflection about cinema and acting
( great actress ,
jack n has been said to have managed the low budget effort as best as possible ,
but instead it is a tired lame home
how cheap is this family ?
unfunny joke
his cheapy dad he is got a job
and playing around in the water messing up shea 's 300 dollar dress yet
she would slap him for messing up her expensive dress so quigley and the other still mad interrogates a little kid and quickly spills the bean and preston is being chased by quigley in a scene
the bottom line is that is a waste of time
as a tortilla the kid is annoying the villain are lame the comic relief
is not funny the other are unlikable the dad is even worse the romantic subplot is creepy the plot 's shallow
so person do not waste your money
what the crap is funny about a dog
who thinks this kind of material is funny ,
because my name is diamond '' .great movie are made with gut like these ,
but this movie was a complete disappointment !
he was great ,
but this movie was really bad .
that disappointed me .
and is boring and lacks any kind of tension.. ?
that for me make the vampyre myth so fascinating .
the scenery looks like cheap theatre .
i found the overall experience to be a fun way to waste some time .
is this some award-winning collection of amazing film ?
these film should be recommended .
and these zombie are fun .
they go from cool rot makeup to the cheapest slap on white-face ever ,
but they are fun .
sheet has a great sense of humor and some humble integrity
the behind the scene of zombie bloodbath is pretty fun as well .
there are some great interview
a fun little film
and many are quite dull ,
this is a solid
so i give this set a solid recommendation .
to make fun zero budget
the cast are all horrible stereotype lumbered with flat dialogue .
avoid
the plot was very predictable .
and the brit were baddy ?
relationship between rea and the sutherland character made this one of my favorite movie of the last 5 year .
the catching of one of the worst mass murderer in history had me on the edge of my seat .
who rode the interurban train for fun ,

that ` ... together you make a wonderful person ' .
perfectly captures the institutional inertia of glasnost
could not 've been greater for the case .
such `limbic dominator ' make poor humans.warning-spoiler :
the best outcome is always the prevention of killing ,
( 10/10 )
i was not disappointed .
ustinov manage to avoid prosecution
and knows the great author asimov
weak premise
why tarnish a great body of work by slapping it is title on your vacuous piece of crap ?
david zucker has directed one of the most enjoyable comedy of the year with this goofy farce .
but it is consistently funny throughout unlike some recent comedic effort .
while other have depended upon making fun of too many famous scene in almost random movie
why kid do stupid thing like wander around in labs and eak bottle .
having just enjoyed most extreme primate a few night
and gives them the same bad dream about the witch and her spider .
his message is that good will always prevail over evil ,
that bad weather is the most effective way
this `` largo winch `` movie is far from perfect ,
and perhaps too predictable at time ,
this is a fantastic film about a quite gifted boy/man with a special body
it was nominated the oscar for best director for jim sheridan
best writing ,
screenplay based on material from another medium and best picture ,
it was nominated the baftas for best film ,
best make up artist and best adapted screenplay .
daniel day-lewis was number 85 on the 100 greatest movie star ,
and he was number 15 on the world 's greatest actor ,
and the film was number 28 on the 50 greatest british film .
the cast is great ,
but he was great as hal in always greener .
this film is deeply disappointing .
and listening absolutely boring .
who were befriended with j.b. lenoir
but his limited look on the theme as well as the neither funny nor utterly fascinating reproduction of story from the 30s render this movie as a mere sleeping aid .
with still public coming to watch.the movie is a great epic
makes this a great ride on the roller-coaster of japanese cinema as well
the soundtrack is sometimes a little bit annoying .
though most of it is great music ,
his neurotic trait combine the best of woody allen with childish naivety .
it strikes a chord with the audience.although this is far from being a perfect movie
the best sex comedy work this way \u0096 from risky business to american pie \u0096
that you are absolutely the greatest actor in the world ,
if deborah messing were not already cast as `` grace '' ,
neither funny
the wedding date slide over the storyline of deceptive sex by ide and best man ,
while messing has perfected the repressed princess ,
expected messing sequel :
brilliantly conceived character such as the shape-shifting dog ralph
a beautiful piece of child 's cinema buried in a world of archaic celticism .
the girl of the forest is a wonderful addition
it starts out funny and endearing with an energy
it begins to drag and everything become sickingly predictable .
i could stomach another predictable love story
that could be worse
and unfortunately that was also the case with dead letter office .
nothing this bad is made by accident ;
too bad
boring futuristic fx and seeing talented person
this is a great story
the only one even mediocre is the excellent ossie davis .
because it is so poorly done in every category .
the story is bad ,
unfortunately for this movie ,
it is no fun watching a fight
that it is a bad idea
one of the fantastic sight
created a great sense of atmosphere .
while the basic idea was great ,
i really would have loved
this final entry in george lucas 's star war movie is often regarded as the weakest of the lot .
what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppet for the various member of jabba 's court ,
and watching him as a fully matured jedi knight makes for an unforgettable performance .
making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas ever.in 1997 ,
( albeit funny
although technically amazing ,
so it is probably best to be warned beforehand.as nice
but these new incarnation are just as much fun ,
and is still great to watch .
the acting is horrible
dull long-winded dribble .
what a laughable movie this was .
pathetic .
and the writing is horrifically bad.none of the story work .
we loved from batb at all ,
`` the perfect word '' is an overbearing
i already loved `` how the grinch stole christmas ''
why this movie is so charming and fun to watch .
costume and character are done perfectly over-the-top in a fun way ,
making at its very best !
and why it is so much fun to watch
he truly carries the movie with his good and fun role .
and so much fun to watch .
other fun and memorable role are being played by jeffrey tambor
for me the movie was simply fun
score by jame horner is good and fun ,
it still all work perfectly for the movie
and helps to make some of the scene 's work.perfect christmas entertainment.8/10
that the average rating for this movie is 5.2/10 for what affects me ,
it is definitely one of the worst movie i
and the acting truly awful .
it is total waste of time
to avoid at any cost .
that message is not.this story is not about charlie fineman
charlie is living like an nutty adolescent boy with a huge trust fund
and had terrible musical taste
-- the control and subtlety of cheadle
a beautiful mixture of flute
this film is one of my favorite movie ,
that my wonderful parakeet of four year died recently .
this is a very funny ealing comedy about a community in central london
( best known as alfred doolittle in my fair lady ) ,
.this is a great script
as well as being a great little eccentric character piece as well .
unfortunately it did not rise above the average individual-with-violent-powers movie .
unfortunately it never seems to live up to its potential and prolongs its plot too much .
the special effect are not bad
and help to carry the movie to the finale.the cast is not bad ,
but it is not the worst of its kind either .
virtually all of the funny moment are in the preview .
funny
that dog can be great company ,
the entire story focused on a poorly behaving dog
the worst movie i have ever seen with jenifer aniston or owen wilson
a waste of their talent .
the best way
whether the previous installment was worse than this one
even poor old robert englund has been in better production than that in the past fifteen year.given
that made part four so insulting
it could not have been that bad
i just kept waiting for a plotline and a funny part ,
in a movie like this bad acting
add up to make a bad movie even worse -
that there are worse movie out there
this is the worst srk movie
and one of the worst bollywood movie i ever saw !
but this movie made it worse !
very bad music
even worse actor
2006parsifal is one of my two favorite wagner opera or music dramas ,
who was his favorite conductor !
this film can not even be said to be bad for it is sadly
( which are predictable and threadbare )
*warning* possible spoiler belowthe film is more boring then anything else .
but none of it works.mst3k did a fairly good job with it ,
both with regard to the character and the dialog.i would read about elizabeth berkly 's awful performance in the equally-awful `` showgirl
while not awful ,
is barely up to the standard of lifetime 's worse fare .
was laughable .
he was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time
i rather enjoyed this part ) ,
`` this whole lame situation should have been resolved - in real life - in about 15 minute ,
they could do even worse .
and that is exactly why this movie was recommended by one of the guy at the cult-movie-video-place.he told me
( one of my favorite !
it was awful ,
i do not ever wan na see this movie again.not awful
and art technique quite like the work of the great czech filmmaker
hine took a great gamble ,
it is totally refreshing to me to have this movie in my liary .
all three great hour of it .
it is still regarded as just another funny picture .
as he is a great actor ,
that it would have been even worse
and to be slower and more subtle .
are endangered with the worst thing since the 1919 flu .
one amazing scene
kazan really takes the camera into place where even person rarely went ,
if it lacks the electricity of the most highly charged thriller ,
they are getting worse every day .
goldie hawn and chris sarandon were the best two in it .
they are chemistry was great .
that is why it saddens me that the class is not funny ,
all kind of dark magic voodoo battle between good and evil.pretty stupid and lame with a weak storyline to suffice .
and you have `` the order '' .i found the sex scene with the priest interlaced with shot of a picture of the virgin mary rather insulting to catholic .
but also because it managed to insult an entire faith in the process .
yet some of the best film of the genre
-- the only copy in perhaps the best stocked video store in manhattan was a rough bootleg from the amc cable channel --
the pacing of this superb film is taut and gripping .
soft-focus beauty is used to great effect .
`` innocent person can get into terrible jam
noir has always reflected the darkest fear ,
and plain boring film-making .
a horrible theme song
n64 and dreamcast were great
a great addition
that was very refreshing .
this one still sticks clearly in my mind as the worst movie of all time ; or at least the worst
as mankiewicz so wonderfully realized ,
and never less than enjoyable throughout .
adelaide is of course also frustrated and disappointed ,
straight and fundamantally severe lady .
the performance even of the stellar jerzy stuhr is here wooden and strangely bad -
he just pulls unfunny faces
full of predictable joke and below-the-waist innuendos .
do not waste your time
on it - this is just bad .
yet the man from snowy river ii possesses every essential characteristic of the first film ; sensationally beautiful cinematography
and a fantastic and deeply moving soundtrack by bruce rowland
geoff burrowes has done a superb job with this film ,
i rated this movie as awful
when these scene are absolutely not funny ?
if you want to waste good money ,
you will be better off than watching this mother of all lousy comedy 's .
but we still enjoyed it .
good message about standing up to bully and of course
and along with `` new voyage '' it is a great continuation !
( great acting ) ,
shelby 's great
but lacks the gritty edge of a commanding officer
as is the wonderful nechayev
( what a beautiful accent - a real russian !
some of the acting is not great
( the end of `` worst fear part 2 '' misses the crunch
that the acting by all the actor was superb .
but i was surprised at how 'awful ' he looked .
( who play the cyborgs in this ridiculous movie )
of all the question left unanswered by this dreadful movie ,
kristofferson is easily the most enjoyable thing about the movie .
and gary daniel is wasted
worst of all
( bad )
i owe this film a degree of acknowledgement as the film
following a great battle
but was sadly never completed .
this could be a really great
cheap and rather silly .
and assuming person are this dumb.the ending is so bad i give it a 1. even if the film starts of promising .
probably the best film of the year for me .
is the amazing chemistry between the two star .
you can feel this amazing bond between carla and paul .
i loved this film
it is one of the best movie i
the plot is fantastic ,
the acting superb and the direction is flawless .
ri'chard is great .
i can not say anything bad about peter galleghar .
he is one of my favorite actor .
certainly one of the dozen or so worst movie ever released in any form ,
as bonanza jellybean plus inconceivably awful voiceover narration by tom robbin
a singularly unfunny musical comedy
it reads like `` so funny in 'the 7 year itch ' ...
a beautiful girl with rumoured 50-inch asset
unfortunately
and the sound quality is also quite poor.perhaps
that can still be enjoyed today ,
4/10 .
`` i never knew a car accident could be so terrible ! ''
this is just a regular boring soft core flick.the woman
but the worst movie sin in my book is to be slow
from the truley awful score to the goofy shiny costume .
horrible in every sense .
that this movie was the best in the last 25 year .
seemingly pointless plot diversion ,
the end of the movie was a great cliffhanger .
a boring movie with what
that was filmed badly ?
the ending is great ,
and i enjoyed seeing the motley crew of character go through it
which actually was not as bad
i gave it a 4/10
that this is the worst film ever made ,
and it would be best to avoid it ,
there would be a couple of cheap laugh
and the story is not only impossible to believe but also predictable and dull .
the character are extremely annoying and heavily stereotyped .
has some wonderful comic one-liner .
obnoxious
couple movie has some wonderful joke about oscar 's apartment and his sloppy habit .
that he becomes more annoying than comical .
tony 's felix unger obviously could be annoying some of the time .
fun
the `` famous '' meatloaf fight is one of the greatest scene ever !
one of the other great example of felix 's `` little note '' on oscar 's pillow will be remembered forever .
( although lightened by a funny line . )
the beginning 20 minute are very boring .
the movie 's ending is predictable and too pat .
unless you are watching the great scene
to make the odd couple the best
and dern never fails to fascinate in about any film.the movie
overall i found this movie quite amusing and fun to watch
( 2 ) do you enjoy amazingly hot girl ?
what a terrible
terrible
one of the worst movie i have seen in my life .
i expected something predictable
do not waste your time .
who used to disguise rebellious message in their film ;
canon merely denotes `` the best '' and supporter of film canon argue
to identify and experience a select compilation of the `` best '' film
function
`` i am not going to waste more of my time
it is beyond insulting .
i loved this movie .
great acting and drama and historically accurate .
not as great as sissi but still rock !
yea the history in this movie is great ,
i love historical movie and queen victorium is very fascinating !
the style are great ,
he could do better than waste his time in this rubbish.this movie
it is.this movie is stupid ,
is too dull and monotonous .
what is the moral or the message
it is not touching and sometimes even boring !
is bad .
and you rarely know
it is bad !
kinnear is also excellent as the regular joe businessman
rarely settling for the trite setup or the easy laugh .
and gene tierney is the beautiful woman
but nothing else about where the sidewalk ends resembles everyone 's favorite sophisticated murder mystery .
cheap restaurant and crummy flat .
where the sidewalk ends belong to a sub-genre of noir ,
among noir protagonist
while many noir romanticize the two-fisted tough guy ,
which contains his best performance ,
can be seen as part of the marvelous fox film noir set .
when it came to film noir .
this movie is wonderfully written and sweetly
was wonderful as ms. novak 's absent-minded-yet-capable upstairs neighbor queenie .
( wonderful performance )
but at least the character were quirky and fun.on a personal note ,
great cat !
to see it for yourself.this is one of my favorite ,
pathetic ... worse than a bad made-for-tv movie .
a lame script and cheap background music made this movie
absolutely one of the worst movie of all time.low production value ,
terrible story idea
bad script
( terrible ) x
rabbit test.avoid this at all costs.it is so bad ,
it is not even funny how bad it is .
he is unseated fellow teuton uwe boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film
this film is as shoddy and laughable as the best-worst of ew .
subterranean ; lommel dug a pit and buried it.the fun begins with the cast of international nobody .
could easily understand how lommel managed to find so many wannabe actor willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face.the main character
is it is perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece .
sadly the actual film was not as good .
but from the beginning the plot was about as predictable
it was not really very funny.in summary the film was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me ,
this is an excellent movie .
( excuse bad spelling
`` excellent acting by all of the cast ,
it was not my favorite of the short ,
but avoid contacting either of them directly .
but rather than just explore the banal detail of any particular event this movie captures the ecstatic truth of adolescent passion and disappointment .
she shields him.before long she is involved with him and unfortunately with his racket .
and owen try pulling a badger game on a drunken paul hurst ,
it is one of the best
absolutely dreadful mexican film supposedly based on a short story by edgar allan poe about a newsman wanting
if i did not have to watch the awful cgi
but all i saw was a bad movie
the story was not as bad as the cgi ,
everyone should know what an excellent movie this is .
it is engaging and funny from moment one
and other truly funny and original fantasy adventure
this is one of the great one .
relative newcomer charlie cox is an incredible leading man .
claire dane is fantastic as always .
there are also a lot of wonderful moment from minor character ...
but it is too pretentious and boring to rise above
the use of virtual set almost work but at some point it fails miserably .
you see what they were aiming for and it would of been great if
bad dvd transfer too .
it was too boring .
to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strand
soldier is not a great movie ,
extremely tedious ,
a smattering of nudity too ( unfortunately
unfortunately
( manchester as tommy is particularly bad ,
this question weighs heavily on the viewer of this movie.recommended .
i was so bored to dead with this pointless effort .
making no sense after first 20 minute is just bad film
to be `` the best film ever made ''
this kind of artificial art grab is just a pathetic way
anthony hopkin as a excellent actor should just stay acting .
unfortunately
too thin and too weak
bad guy and worse guy .
it is fun to see jame belushi using his humor
did i have fun watching this movie .
you could argue about the twist being predictable .
pure fun !
said `` great acting . ''
these are two great actor giving horrible performance
for a great director in his all-time worst effort .
mostly because the character is so poorly written .
i give it 1/10 ,
truly one of the worst 20 movie for its budget level
envy stars some of the best .
and the great christopher walken .
one can only expect the best .
hence the name of the movie.the concept is not bad ,
but it still turns out awful .
this movie contains some of the worst dialog and very poor performance from all the cast .
not even the great christoper walken ,
made this movie funny .
the movie is bad from the start
and only continues to get worse.i recommend this movie if :
avoid this movie at all cost ,
but avoid especially if :
their search for the perfect location leads them to the shark infested water of lilo-cay .
hickox this is one awful film ,
but it is still not as bad as tobe hooper crocodile
the script by sam bernard and robert l.levy is terrible
the whole film is also frustratingly predictable as well
the crocodile effect are awful
again it looks terrible .
but rather scarily it is still not as bad
definitely one to avoid .
it is boring and slow and for a show
and yes battlestar galactica had some of the same issue but not nearly as bad .
and it is a poor pre sequel to it .
-spoiles- lame south of the border adventure movie
the casting is perfect and the acting standard very high .
halicki 's classic seventy chase film is simply horrible .
enjoyable in spite of leslie howard 's performance .
thank to her performance she ings this rather dull movie to life .
about the worst idea you have ever heard .
this picture 's funnier than any 3 dozen seth rogen project .
these blonde in padded chintz suit with nonfunctioning strap and redundant zipper want to replace godzilla with king ghidorah ,
and some other heretofore unscathed-by-rubber-monster metropolitan area being laid waste by a flying gold metalflake 1/3 of a hydra .
in a wonderful nod to those notoriously self-willed whipping head
that is is boring and false ,
really boring after an half of hour
of what a bad movie is like ,
do not waste precious time of your life on this piece of trash .
bad acting ,
horrible
( but i mean really horrible )
that are so bad
they are funny ?
just plain old pathetic .
it offers us only a few thrill and one really creepy sequence with skeleton in the fireplace.a lot of computer generated special effect and nothing more.catherine zeta-jone is beautiful as always ,
is amazing
and form your own opinion on it.i give this picture 7/10 .
and the actor were very funny .
if you are are looking for a funny movie
i would tell you some of my favorite part
lot 's of beautiful person
it is a fun film to watch !
jesse and chace are funny too ,
he has a wonderful flair for self-deprecating comedy .
the whole movie was poorly written
poorly directed
and poorly acted .
and as bad
this is actually worse .
this movie has 1 funny point at the very beginning with the exchange between the narrator and george :
studio too cheap to pay brendan fraser .
sadly ,
that is the only funny part in the entire movie.it was still entertaining ... but then again ,
this is the worst movie i have ever seen
funny movie ,
costume are so beautiful and authentic .
one of my favorite is the narrator and nephew ,
the best part of course- is george c. scott as ebenezer scrooge .
`` god forgive me for the time i have wasted . ''
i will be bothering to look them out though.this is an awful film .
terrible acting
bad dialogue
cheap rubber monster .
the most sympathetic character die really quickly
and leave you with the annoying one
the really interesting twist are that the stranger is a beautiful
some predictable
but it is a whole lot of fun .
( this is the perfect character for her ) ,
because it is just one of the best feel-good movie i have seen .
sean young 's character is completely unsympathetic .
her performance is wooden at best .
the storyline is completely predictable
it is one of the worst movie i
this is a horrible movie .
and all the story are bad .
with bad bill paxton as a maniac roommate should not be viewed by anyone .
sadly the best is almost incomprehensible
the film did ing out a few old great though
chris mckenna does the best job
the dance sequence are not perfect ,
it was truly a lot of fun .
the special effect were wonderful .
that i thought were terrible .
i have seen worse of this too .
it is an excellent interpretation
awful
just awful !
the book is one of my favorite and its a shame
definitely stupid to take the baby from a safe place
she is such a great actress !
after a while the novelty of this world of nothing become rather dull ,
i do rank this as a thoroughly enjoyable film !
avoid this crap at all cost .
bad script
bad directing
bad acting
bad editing
bad sound
the actor try there best ,
roy schieder does great job
also features some beautiful and sexy woman
very bad movie ... ... ..and i mean very bad ...
the plot is predictable ,
very poorly portrayed from idea to screen ,
the plot is somewhat predictable at time ,
this show proved to be a waste of 30 minute of precious dvr hard drive space .
but if you want a great horror movie go watch the shining or rosemary 's baby .
those are the two best horror film ever made .
probably the worst `` major release '' film i have seen in my life .
definitely the worst for this year .
it lays in the absolute stupidity of the annoying kind
( not the funny kind )
why i gave it a 2/10 instead of 1/10 .
avoid at any cost .
and the character is constantly a fascinating car wreck .
there is always a worse version possible ,
it is much more fascinating than understanding the truth .
and the horrible video effect
not even so bad
it is fun .
avoid .
the casting alone makes it a nearly perfect movie .
and it is funny too .
this is a bad
definitively not funny ,
but very much boring and annoying
bad script
bad acting .
it is a complete waste of time -
i am afraid.1/10 point .
but neither was i expecting it to be so awful .
( not to mention at opposite pole of the noir universe ) .
and dyed-in-the-wool noir
which the french first dubbed `noir
specifically big apple - noir
but it is still kinda fun.it has some genuine laugh ...
i really enjoyed watching it.i would recommend this movie over `` santa claus conquers the martian ''
there is no redeeming character in the film
it is very hard to feel bad about dr. beck 's turning into a bat
not to mention the horrible cinematography ,
not the worst film i have ever seen on mst3k
i am not sure whether to blame some of the idiotic line on the actor or the writer ...
and i always feel bad saying that ,
but it was basically a two-hour waste of my life .
is that this movie is either a poor attempt to indoctrinate person or a joke .
that you do not waste your time.if
seeing this movie was the most fun i
i am not able to say whether this is a good or a bad film ,
( karishma kapoor )
yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance.karishma kapoor is the one with most work
without becoming ridiculous .
making movie can be the most fun in the world !
adapting play into cinema is often a bad idea
it is a great idea
`` blimey there is thousand of them out there `` great movie and a bad stage play
to make great cinema
whether it was trying to be serious or funny .
if you want to see a great translation of a stage play
lorne greene was great
as adama and richard hatch was perfect
i loved the episode with the pegasus and greeting from earth was good john calicos was great as baltar
the best was experiment in terra ,
as cassiopea was fantastic .she had beauty
these poor slug have been mutated through the pollution of evil human and do not mean to do anything malicious ,
the real bad guy are the human ,
who either actively try to destroy our beloved slug ,
how can you blame that on the slug ? this movie paints a portrait of human
this parade of loathsomeness is rounded out by the guy from the mst3k classic `` pod person ''
in one pointless scene
if you are a fan of bad cinema ,
lame special effect
pointless scene
and poor dubbing
including on the ship 's funnel .
the story is weak ,
the acting is weaker
and that was a waste of money
which where a bit disappointing
the acting is perhaps not the best around
that are unfunny ,
and there is an awful lot of the movie with no stooge on camera .
i loved everything
but this little dogie is pretty lousy .
jim brolin was surprisingly funny .
is funny here as well .
he is great ,
but the best aspect of this movie was the casting of julia stile .
and girl child were considered so worthless to poor parent
even though she is showed great promise as street-performing heir .
i was so disappointed
i found the series wonderful !
it is truly enjoyable !
clean and wonderful !
and it comes around full swing in this great movie with a superb twist .
the end is perfect though .
subtle little satire
a bit of a disappointing film
there is no way to avoid the overtly religious
there were some very funny moment in the film ,
that is the best part .
unfortunately
and i was not disappointed .
it is laughable to say the least
with bad effect
i can give you four reason to see this movie:1. four of the best filmmaker in the contemporary mexican cinema.2 .
a surprisingly good cast.4 .
but after the recent lynching at tlahuac and the tradition in this awful matter at the state of mexico
( and maybe enjoyed it )
she does look great in a man 's army shirt
low budget horror fan will get a kick out of seeing cult favorite brinke steven as a religious fanatical mother
calling her a murderer as beloved troma producer lloyd kaufman is the aloof father
but for the subtle thing it reveals
( avoid foreign entanglement )
because i usually find on them insipid and boring screenplay
the excellent film the young victorium does not fall on that situation ,
because of its fascinating story
the excellent performance from emily blunt
and for some reason i feel insulted
is also an insult to the blade and the soul inside ,
which insults the samurai caste even more.also ,
when he finds out his boss is a baddie .
we have great cinematography
( which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it ) ,
and an insult
2.5/10 bleah
in the funeral of the famous british journalist joe strombel
`` scoop '' is another great woody allen 's comedy outside manhattan ,
his ironic and witty line are simply fantastic ,
sid waterman is extremely funny
and woody allen is in an excellent shape as comedian .
and is annoying in many moment ,
and i was quite disappointed with her performance
this movie is truly amazing and heartwarming .
reese witherspoon is so charming and jason london 's not so bad either !
but it was still one of the most amazing movie i
i quite enjoyed it .
p7/10 .
unfortunately
and they have fallen short of the great potential in the character .
early draft of the miramax project attempted to adapt one of the best novel ,
the film does not come across as cheap .
he is a perfectly fine actor -
it was perfect .
this a great disney flick.it is the story of an aging high school baseball coach
and even makes the roster.this is a great family film.it
but does not pour it on too thick.it is fun
look no further.9/10
not mean they are stupid .
as sin.the worst thing is the obviousness of it all .
to make it all as stupid as possible .
great child 's movie are wicked
something seems bad with this movie .
instead we get risibly bad song and dance sequence featuring picturesque beggar and whore ,
migene at least has a great voice and some feel for the material .
julia looks perfect as mack ,
it was a bad move
by filming at claustrophobic angle on mist-shrouded set lit in garish blue and orange as if by some bargain-basement vittorio storaro fails utterly
-- the film just looks cheap
in this beautifully acted
slightly ridiculous english countryside was an appealing
( and annoyingly )
fontaine is too beautiful
is painfully awful .
astaire 's romantic comedy skill is no less enjoyable here than in any of his film with ginger roger and his dance scene
mixing with noble but dull-spirited englishman .
the acting was terrible
being this bad in a long time ,
even that could not save this movie from being just a terrible excuse
you have the strong urge to waste $ 3 .
it is a great education
for better and worse
and mostly pointless animation sketch lifted from `` animal farm . ''
is actually pretty annoying in execution .
and their opinion add nothing to his story.this picture is at it is best
who gets on her bad side .
and i do not want a refund !
great dialog and well-drawn character
that i cared about ( even bad guy miklos )
i came to nancy drew expecting the worst ...
the plot was enjoyable and thrilling with a lot of actual scare and i thought
there were several funny moment and on the contrary of many statement
i loved this movie .
it might be funny .
as being funny .
it is just stupid.i heard good thing about napoleon dynamite too ,
a surprisingly interesting meditation on the nature of regret in term of the way
the scare are very subtle
it is not perfect ,
this is absolutely the worst movie i have seen all year.first ,
whose source of self confidence comes from a pair of leather slippers.this was worse
her acting was superb as well .
she was absolutely wonderful
that this movie was described as such wonderful thing as `` a little gem . ''
but tonight was the perfect opportunity .
i popped it in and was glued to the beautiful cinematography
his character 's presence.this is truly a wonderful movie .
but it is still pointless and cheap .
`` the fallen one '' fall under the waste of life
but when served is bland with no flavor at all .
are simply the best .
stupid plot and over-the-top `` vanity fair '' are not a problem
i can re-watch his best music video
( which are artistically beautiful )
that it was great
and `` moonwalker '' are all great ,
( with a solid `` smooth criminal '' theme
and that monstrous monster and long knifes never will be the best way of achieving this .
it is the best of it is kind .
the governmant blames richard for the massacre earning him the name `` butcher of bakersfield '' .
running man is another one of arnold 's great movie from the 80 's .
it is not and i do not care anyway i loved the movie .
also the cast was great besides arnold
and is laughable garbage
and it is still great to this day .
the futuristic world and humor are great .
definitely one of his best .
above-average film and acting partly spoiled by its completely predictable story line .
but i thoroughly enjoyed this film .
is of course the sequel to another one of my favorite film cabin by the lake .
that i enjoyed this movie even more than the first one .
that the cast in this movie was great ,
judd nelson is always the best !
i also enjoyed the plot as a whole .
if you are looking for a fun way
`` soylent green '' is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction movie of the 70 's
( in a great shape )
and there is a great
that this is one of the best i ever seen .
the plot was weak to say the least .
the best part of the film is definitely dani behr ,
i very much enjoyed watching this film .
i actually enjoyed the second viewing
i was not disappointed .
but unfortunately had to learn in a very painful manner
( who is always wonderful
the first time my best friend and i sat down to watch this movie ,
was and is the best one of its genre .
we see the beautiful and liberated mary godwin
played by beautiful and talented alice krige .
this movie was based on a wonderful book `` haunted summer '' by anne edward .
disney at its worst ! 8 .
it did not even have the youthful sex appeal of mediocre to poor movie like i know
is awful here
and `` the postman always rings twice '' in the 40 's - this was a great example of modern film noir in the 90 's .
favorite line :
the movie was bad .
the acting is superb .
are excellent in their role ...
the plot was predictable ,
the acting was mediorcre at best ,
the beach are fantastic
his acting seems to flow between no feeling or empathy whatsoever to display of some really bad overacting .
takashi miike 's master of horror-episode is boring
uninspiring and pointless .
really bad !
fun movie
all the actor are perfectly cast
and they are all great supporting actor .
reginald gardiner has always been a favorite supporting actor of mine
and i had completely forgotten this gem .
maggie smith is perfect as the bumbling secretary/neighbor
but in fact the character are so involving and so much fun
almost.let down your usual expectation of modern comedy and look for the great performance and friendly
illogical mess ,
there are worse stephen king adaptation
there is one solitary laughable elemant in `` whipped '' -
during the amigo 's detailed discussion of their bodily function and the tantric talent of the bed partner
that a buddy movie with a great setting
great performance
even the zombie are boring.i was hoping for at least a `` so bad it is good '' zombie movie ,
but this one is `` so bad those
forget the hideous special effect and poorly-constructed one-dimensional character .
just how badly this film was pieced together.i know 9 year old
the story is horrible .
the acting is comical and the message its trying to show is incomprehensible .
and what worse
that would be enjoyable on some level ,
very pathetic .
that you actually sat through such a horrible movie
i loved the way
thank to the cast for some wonderful tv .
the cinematography gives a bad
yeah cheap shot i know ,
but this movie is a great example
can be combined haphazardly to great critical acclaim
yet fails to tie them together into the coherent meditation kundera offered .
it also fails to even include token screen time for tomas ' son ,
'east is east ' was fun and sharp ;
'anita and me ' seems obvious and dull in comparison .
the soundtrack is great with inspiring rock eg .
and avoid like the biblical plague.awful -
that i have just wasted the end
what a waste.this film has so incensed me
that everybody i have ever watched it with has loved
but if you happen to come across one you will not be disappointed .
and the character were boring .
and the other seemed to read their line from a teleprompter.the worst part of this movie
if you recognize yourself in this avoid this movie like the plague .
boring ... that short enough ?
on a side note my sister loved this movie .
the performance were bad by most of the cast ...
the editing was equally bad.. i will just stop now.. its all bad 2/10
acting- nothing short of superb .
is superb .
all of these actor perform to the best quality ,
and all giving an excellent performance in each episode .
each episode is directed superbly
and the score of this show is just fantastic .
but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the television ,
and it is really a great story .
and time after time situation occurring in it reminded me of a poor 90 's chevy chase comedy .
it would have sucked even worse .
this movie turned out bad ...
both of us proclaiming `` this is the dumbest thing i have ever seen '' .
talk about pointlessly writing yourself in !
that this series was the best of the 'spy ' genre .
ian holm 's portrayal of the vulnerable but courageous bernard samson was amazing .
( he is always amazing . )
this movie is fun to watch .
but all in all it is a great romp .
joe haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as ebenezer jackson and its a credit to syke
go wrong.i was expecting the worst
-- the bad stuff :
jake weber is a horrible actor ;
is laughable.the good stuff :
pretty good dramatic script ; clarkson is excellent as the mother ; some great direction with eerie sound effect
hanging out around town and carousing at their favorite bar ,
pamela reed as emory 's sympathetic wife and john doucette
as his dying father all turn in excellent performance in this fine picture .
how utterly awful the whole experience was .
it was bad enough to have some kind of a `` story ''
absolutely terrible in all respect !
of how many terrible joke in the movie
the cat in the hat talked was annoying ...
it is funny
what ever you do do not waste your time on this pointless .
worst movie i ever saw .
but yet his suit was still perfectly pressed and shirt crisp white until the very last scene.although a good cast with ellen bernstein
it is amazing how good actor can do such bad movie .
this movie is as much fun
either way this is a poorly directed
that her whole head could have blown off ... robert loggia exhibits a weak and fearful disposition ,
would of enjoyed it as much or even watched it
a bad ending i must say
and some of the actor were not really good but all in all i rated this movie 7/10.the suspense of wondering what lillard was actually up to was what really keeped me interested in this movie.its a good rental ! 7/10
this is a great film - esp
who label the film `` boring ''
brilliant kung-fu scene
end makes barefoot kid an unforgettable film.one of the silliest subtitle i have seen ...
wasteful and destructive us human are .
and they are quite willing to tell us just how bad
but this suited him perfectly ,
perfect for christmas .
i enjoyed this movie a lot .
all i had was an incredible urge to slam my head against the theatre wall
unfortunately
this has to be one the best movie about serial killer
both of their performance are subtle masterpiece
omitting these fact is an insult to the tragedy .
casting was also very poor .
first hour and the half was wasted on establishing the relationship between the character
to do so made it even worse .
joke were too abundant and rather lame .
the best thing about this film were its special effect ,
if you want to see something funny go watch `` no on would tell ''
i have seen funner stuff everywhere else but here .
christopher lloyd is funny
but it has great special effect
that did not stop me from appreciating this fantastic comedy .
the character are all very funny and believable .
why this movie was so funny
that it makes fun of rap from a different .
it is a funny movie with many joke about racism
were on snl during the longest stretch of unfunny writing and sketch-making
these two woman most especially know what is funny ,
who never had the fun spring eak trip
because you never quite know what fun is to these character .
funny as always )
unfortunately
and the disappointing `` click ''
and the magazine probably would not have sued for trademark infringemant
this movie would have been great and not nearly as run-of-the-mill as frat-house comedy
dratch will come up with another funny concept ,
she is funny enough ,
helps keeping the minimalistic narrative fun and seducing .
we get a rather so-bad-its-funny piece of mediocrity.jeff fahey plays ray trueblood
the film is quite ridiculous .
and it certainly remains the best movie of renny harlin 's career .
this film is so bad
most bad film are funny
unfortunately
all the rest fails so badly ,
haim 's perfect girlfriend ?
the perfect murder ... almost ?
they could have made this flick any lamer
a stupid
unfunny film with a story
great accomplishment ! one last question for mr. haim :
but the horror aspect was quite bad .
in fact it was quite ridiculous .
but unfortunately it is empty and without focus .
the ending is very disappointing
that i am disappointed
but not as a film to be enjoyed .
even though it had a poor cast .
( horrible move ) ,
jay hernandez did his best
i am extremely disappointed
i can not tell you how to waste your money .
rather horrible
mess of a film with the filmmaker cutting loose the rein
which dispatched the annoying punk towards the end ,
that this is one of the greatest television shows ever .
it is great that this show still airs .
and she sometime said something funny .
that was a great episode .
i do not care how many bad review purple rain gets ,
excellent movie
great music
my generation loved this movie growing up ,
so many of us loved prince
the movie has some great music
and sexy fun scene between prince and appelonia .
and arkin are all incredible .
sheryl lee is wonderful as well
although not the best anime i have ever seen but i enjoyed lady death.i have never read the comic book
his dark uiting style was perfect for this kind of movie.i think
cause everything person have bashed this can be said about everyone favorite anime vampire hunter d
that garfield carries off memorably in a great performance
the best scene are on guadalcanal ,
i quite enjoyed this movie for two reason .
which is very rarely treated in movie ,
it is great to hear liza
but there are too many bad song ,
the fight scene may not be great..
- bad stuff :
but they are quickly shot down by the bad stunt work and acting .
as did hazel o'connor 's amazing look and charismatic vocal performance
he was so out of place in the band and so harmless and pathetic ,
favorite scene
but it was really excellent for its limited budget and for its portrayal of the britain of the early 80 's
it is a great movie
with some wonderful performance ,
there are some great shot .
close-up by candle light suggest the beautiful work of the classical painter and it is fascinating to watch the painter and their student
to study under the great florentine artist
billowing their voluminous clothing add wonderful effects.artemisia
beautiful story of wisconsin native
that one feel in loosing a special loved one ,
and the struggle to productively cope and rise above the great loss !
it is the incredible story of dan jansen 's hearteak in loosing his beloved sister to leukemia
`` recommended for anyone
who has ever suffered the great loss of someone very special ,
and dearly loved within your life !
and the bad evolution of most direct cinema.really
of being filmed.it would have been very disappointing
even as they blame each other for their life ,
a beautiful portrait of stylistic importance and a charm
to appear completely starker in this dreadful piece of trash
the naked female form is a beautiful thing and nothing to be ashamed of ) .
who are more than willing to co-star with a badly made hand-puppet
and proceed to use three beautiful young woman as guinea pig .
this and of comedy is one of the worst
sarah creates an annoying
unfunny character .
it is not funny anymore .
funny and poignant
it is one of the very rare movie
it could have been boring and silly but instead ,
superb writing
with the full cast of the dysfunctional and disillusioned.there is a cheating husband
an annoying girlfriend
it is an incredible piece of savage consciousness
it is really nothing short of pathetic .
really bad shot on video `` film ''
once in a while a bit of black appears to separate scenes.terrible music by bad heavy metal band
as disappointingly thin ,
it may be because the subject herself is mildly disappointing .
natural fun .
not least of which are the amazing bandw noir cinematography of w. mott hopfel iii
pitch-perfect performance by some of our most underrated supporting actor
mol does several scene fully naked and most other in amazing period lingerie and `` specialty '' costume
progressing through degree of progressively less `` bad '' audition and student acting scene is to see a truly fine actress in complete control of her craft.the script does effectively ing us into 1950 's america ,
jean arthur 's character was somewhat annoying and jame ellison just did not look like nor act like `` buffalo bill . ''
cooper was not at his best
that films like this never snag best picture nomination ,
not to mention the incredible cast .
it i loved it and became thrilled .
it became my favorite short film
the photography is beautiful in every short and shot ,
at the worst being nothing special -
my special favorite are the `` quais de seine '' first scene
beautiful.ye
these are some beautiful short films.now let 's get onto the content .
i loved coming from a simple
it is great they took a chance
that are not exactly the best - `` quais de seine ''
( look out for alexander payne in a funny role )
great question .
i enjoyed it very much
most short i loved and all of them together form a beautiful and energetic mix .
watch it if you like eclectic beautiful love !
the soundtrack is great also .
and similar to the way american werewolf in london used every great wolf song
best line missing from the quote section btw ~ 'once
i particularly loved the ending of the film ,
i thought was a perfect way
very light and fun ; it leaves you laughing and smiling ,
with talking animal and stereotype every five minutes.what i got was an amazing film ,
filled with beautiful scenery and animation
and an amazing storyline
that has the great potential
this unsung quiet gem tells the true story of a pow escape during ww ii .
the performance are incredible
and this is one of the worst documentary of i have ever seen of any type .
tediously
in fact.it is also predictable pretty much through and through.number one and two were somewhat predictable ,
which i did not really think fit this series and the character.jeff fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment.he is a decent enough actor ,
which would have been great
there were some pretty bad one liners.arnold vosloo return in the title role
it is pretty bad.my vote for darkman iii :
i rarely write a negative review for this site ,
without doubt one of the dullest film i have ever seen.there was nothing happening in this film
really enjoyed `` one hour photo ''
what is more disappointing is that i am sure
but it just did not work for me.i might even have given it 1/10
since half the movie revolves around the stage production of the play.the film has a great cast with signe hasso and shelley winter as the woman in colman 's life
one of the best `` amitabh comeback '' movie i liked .
it an easy 8/10 just for being pure bollywood .
it is supposed to be a fun
yet stupid movie ,
then you will be sorely disappointed .
unfortunately ,
just a warning ... this is the worst movie i
it is a pure waste of time ...
horrible acting
incredibly bad line
beautiful scenery
( a great food fight ) ,
it is one of the best book i have read last year .
some of the best part of the book was omitted from the movie
and the character were weak with hatsumomo
been the worst .
and one plus one is a great example of his ineptitude
would you have boring voice-over reading tedious political diatribe at your audience
brilliant
the bookshop scene was not worthy of even the worst fringe theatre ,
and was an insult to the intelligence of even the young child
that godard 's one-time great friend
made the best film about film-making ever ,
and godard made the worst with le mepris !
and came across this bizarre gem of a film.this movie
whether they loved it or they hated it .
in its beautiful and quirky way
and the picture they returned are both amazing and hearteaking .
there are amazing sight as well as amazing human story in this film ,
and a true indication of the best and worst
and it is still great every time i see it .
with amazing flamenco dancing
wonderful music.this telling of carman is a story within a story
making at it is best and probably my all time favorite foreign film .
it was not at all a bad movie
as being at best conventional and at worst kind of confusing and one-dimansional
but it is possibly the most fluid- if not quite my personal favorite- of the few he made ,
part out-of-this-world fantastic
( my favorite was the momantary skeleton-guide-
action and incredible design .
not great ,
that the mother does an excellent job
the acting is superb ,
annoying colleague lauren
this is the best film
its an amazing piece of film
if there is any real flaw its the cheapness of the production .
else.do not get me wrong i do like the film a great deal .
we have.it is too bad
just another cheap monster movie from nu image '' .
produced cheap but very entertaining b - picture in the past few month
but also some very disappointing movie .
but `` hammerhead '' turned out to be an excellent revival of the 1950s monster movie .
and it does not matter anyway cause `` hammerhead '' is action and horror entertainment at it is best .
and poorly done ,
it is also very cool and funny to see what we can not see :
fun and some nice artwork too .
even watching the commercial for lady and the tramp ii was a horrible experience .
everything is just a rehash of the original movie and even several of bluth 's really bad movie .
are just a really poor carbon copy of timon and pumbaa .
the song are pathetic
it is pathetic and simplistic .
all of the usual character are not as annoying
do not waste your money on this .
this film was a waste of time ,
you should avoid ,
but it is so funny .
instead of writing the best story possible ,
besides being dysfunctional ,
while not a horrible film ,
it serves to confuse the viewer and distract armstrong from arriving at the truth.this thriller is made enjoyable by sean connery ,
why he is one of our best actor .
two word describes it - stupid and insulting ,
but even worse
it is simply horrible beyond word
that they share the same message .
boring and soulless film ?
than reiterate how truly awful the acting is .
really great done .
giving the movie such an incredible new force
( even tough never got weak or boring )
but wonderful place .
but the fantastically illiant writing means
there are not more bad review .
this is a waste of time ?
the parody of `` swinging the alphabet '' is lame ,
to determine what is and is not funny .
the underlying message of an over-50 woman unable to make it on her own ,
without male assistance is bad
bad
bad .
the acting is uniformly dull
a little melancholic person with great and remarkable personalitiesif
simon yam was my favorite character here
winning for best actor
best picture
best director
and best screenplay .
( which i loved ) ,
mr. knightley is one of the greatest romantic leading man in film .
northam 's knightley is a delight to watch.other wonderful characterization include the comic juliet stevenson
( how much more stupid can you get ? ?
of watching the worst of scifi channel original movie ,
avoid this film like the plague .
`` it is the best movie i
that whoever murders the animal can be regarded as the greatest
gallindo 's slasher is a surprisingly good effort
trampa has a subtle undercurrent of a moral to its story ,
the killer looks great in creepy army fatigue and white valentine-style mask and the attempt at originality just about work .
and it is pretty funny and quite inventive despite being a somewhat one-joke cartoon .
still worth a 7/10.however ,
this show is so fun and unique
funny and adventurous .
why is this film so bad ?
if being so stupidly annoying and unfunny
the character of corky romano is unlikable at best and downright infuriating at worst .
the gag are predictable
but that is not what makes it bad .
they are the lame sort of predictable joke
that your unfunny friend would say.corky romano is about a mild mannered vet
was the lack of truly original and funny joke .
as if the screenwriter had more of a fun time writing this
this film was excellent - the emotional power of tom hulce and ray liotta 's performance ought tear to my eye and joy to my heart - this film shows us
unfortunately
unfortunately that label has got a peerlessly abysmal track record with dtv slasher .
veil 's slasher opus is still one of the best genre piece
some superb cinematography and a couple of the goriest set piece
and pasted from them.certainly the inclusion of the mouth-watering jenna jameson was a great move by the producer .
taylor and jenna delivered expectedly poor dramatic ,
veil 's direction of the cinematography was excellently constructed
it was indeed a great idea .
and the singing and dancing is mediocre .
but the story is great .
i loved watching walken in this role
and if the song were not great ,
great fun .
but was it really necessary to disguise this message .
while the message is good ,
except for one by rufus wainwright and teddy thompson are simply terrible .
and jarvis cocker were particularly annoying .
which were also difficult to watch due to the poor camera work .
selected for this performance were just awful.hopefully there
.technically the movie is close to perfect .
unfortunately a weak plot
i was quite disappointed .
it was funny
boring
how bad this is ... nothing of any importance ever happens
they are all sadly unconvincing
worst of all
the conclusion really makes the whole movie pointless.the alleged `` killer cut ''
that i watched is 86 minute of pure tedium.1/10
but as far a being one of the best australian film ever ,
pro juryalthough the lead actress is strikingly beautiful ,
that some lifeless bland powder is fake ,
that were quite boring ,
where the plot was poor
or waste film
sadly
i do not remember `` barnaby jone '' being no more than a very bland
great composer jerry goldsmith 's excellent theme song .
being badly miscast .
( even more so if one could understand their pointless babble ) .
other actor were just dreadful !
a terrible portrayal .
it was not very funny
as it was not particularly funny
and the movie sent out confusing message .
offering ridiculous project like `` aaham lincoln 's doctor 's dog '' to studio executive -
how you can take an excellent actor ,
and put him to waste in a film such as this .
robert de niro is one of the best hollywood star of all time ,
do not waste your time with this drivel.my rating :
3/10
if you set your heart in.it is amazing
was great from outer space .
and so pathetic .
i loved the book its based off of ,
and i loved the first movie ,
the pointless banter between the two main character in the prequel was completely predictable and unoriginal ,
how bad the movie was .
since the acting was just horrible .
and by b-movie i mean bad movie ,
deeply moving wartime drama with excellent production and lead performances.one of the best
if not the best tv movie of the 1990 's which possibly would 've had even greater success
worthy of comparison with the finale to it is a wonderful life
this is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section
which are wonderfully fresh
many of the inventive story could easily have been made into great sci-fi movie of their own .
what happens next was always unpredictable.the character
but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor .
they are simply fun to watch.starting somewhere around season 5 ,
the character were still as great as ever
unfortunately the 'gear ' of 'the krell '
-- -wasted by ignorance
beautifully rendered.and considering its age ,
you will see/hear no pure 'synth ' and perfectly syched moog background
yet another example of the complete waste of uk lottery money .
who funded this miserable garbage
to make the lead character remotely sympathetic until the last minute .
add to this the terrible acting and the laughable appearance of the creature
and i say 'brilliant !
that ill be watching a stupid movie if nothing more .
i thought to myself '' i better get a pen and a paper to jot down the bad thing about this film ''
this film was great .
great
she is so damn beautiful
who has nailed her role perfectly
the great thing is that it tackles the issue of how silly these person are with style
and does not make them boring .
the screenplay is beautiful
the best thing
who loved the two classic novel by edward ormondroyd
will be disappointed in this film .
an unfortunately high-strung heart patient .
`` the trap is set for a wickedly funny who'll-do-it . ''
the cast is enjoyable
`` deathtrap '' is a fun film to watch again ;
does not automatically make a more compelling picture ? a regrettably dreadful movie .
great story that always keeps you wondering and thinking .
the music is superb ,
go to see it for enjoyment and fun .
who sadly failed in their attempt herethe story was good
but the handling was not that good and the heroine was shown too regressive and the climax too was disappointingdirection is bad music is goodrishi reprises his role of yaarana
it is an excellent fan fiction film series and i can not wait to see more i
i have already recommended it too other person
is excellent especially the ship
multi-functional copy machine
fails to live up
and not all that funny .
just is not all that funny .
`play ' funny
he `knows ' he is being funny --
so rather than being `funny
so what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting ,
that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with
whose subtle delivery is convincing ,
that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someone 's comedic cannon ,
i rate this one 1/10 .
-- they meet ridiculously
within minute i feel great ! !
acting is uninspired and perfunctory .
playing out as a sort of pre runner to the great escape some 13 year later ,
that may well be the first of its type ? .7/10
it is just dull and endless and not worth the time .
but the print is so bad
her despair is great :
thing get plenty messy
the message is fassbinder 's m.o .
in which eddie murphy is at his very best .
my favorite act is the one
who falls from the stairs.this show is the best medicine
if you watch the sequel 'raw ' do not be disappointed .
that generally makes the movie alot funnier ,
that is more than crap in your pant funny ,
some of the funny scene would not have existed.if you have read any pro review about this movie ,
because basically all the reviewer didnt like this film.baseketball is a great comedy
that gives everyone what they want.8/10 .
that would certainly get my suspicion aroused.the great st. louis bank robbery had two director charle guggenheim and john stix .
two joker decided steve 's performance was best served
as the worst ever done by steve mcqueen .
( his own and the person of the amazon with whom he lived and loved )
this movie beautifully conveys both the quirkiness and generosity of the man ,
and i was expecting something funny
i was on the floor laughing my butt off this movie is so great .
he is among the worst director of all time
jr. and ray dennis steckler and the pantheon of awfulness .
i was a tad disappointed
because although the film was indeed bad ,
this film was not particularly fun
to watch for us bad movie fans.now i was wary about watching this film ,
the result of all this is total confusion.sadly ,
it shows surprisingly little
it is not bad enough or sexy enough to care about and the film manages to be rather boring even with such a crazy title like `` naughty stewardess '' .
although it would be a waste of time .
the plot is so predictable
a ridiculous and uncritical version of the american dream .
to succeed in this attempt due to the bad script and the shallow acting .
especially piper perabo completely fails in convincing one of `` jersey 's '' fear
( and quite funny thing )
( it is much more funny
( 3/10 ) .
drunk and acting obnoxious ,
that he would be great in the right movie .
to see a talented guy wasted in a film
that features unfunny after unfunny situation ,
and cap it all with a dreadfully bad song and dance scene .
because the movie is so bad ,
not because it is funny.oh well ,
it is just too bad
i found this movie so adorable and funny
it was unfortunately signed to
being boring and moralist
unfortunately he will not repeat the success with his second movie `` da zero a dieci '' -not good at all.in `` radiofreccia '' actor are generally not very famous ,
it was fun and funny ,
dode ' ka-den may not be kurosawa 's best ,
but coming from the greatest director of all time ,
my guess is that it tried to send a message of some sort ,
but that just got wasted on me.what i felt
that is basically this is a mediocre movie with nice special effect .
the river princess is terrible cute
that i rewarded other movie with 1/10 ,
this one makes quite some bad movie
but it was just too plain boring
some person actually reward this with 10/10 .
is not too bad ,
this is a weak film with a troubled history of cut and re-naming .
the ending may be funny
that i almost felt it insulted my intelligence
it is a perfect example of the well-rounded surprising story
with richard gere and the simply awful jennifer lopez .
subtle and wonderfully acted .
it is typical hollywood unoriginal crass commercialism at it is worst .
not the terrible full screen .
2.johnny stechino-very funny italian mistaken identity flic !
i consider this film one of the worst in the nightmare series .
it was so boring
the dream child is neither funny nor is it scary .
it is quite a mess.my rating :
4/10
# 6 is also a messy one ... )
this one does it with a near-perfect structure .
here we see a bunch of superb actor
the structure around the parallelism of the two culture is wonderful .
how wonderful
this film is probably best characterized as a sweet
`` witchery '' might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80 's but
it has a few compensating quality like fantastic gore effect
the dysfunctional family
xica da silva is one of the best brazilian opera soap ever !
as the princess all work wonderfully well .
also wrote the perfect screenplay
that i was stunned-this amazing classic can be watched time an again
there is a great scene of spock surrendering to a flabbergasted mccoy ,
that it was going to be boring and wondered how could they ever improve upon the 1984 version of bachelor party starring tom hank ,
sure there were some funny moment
4/10 is my vote for this one .
he could do the role of `` ratzo '' is a gem -
nor that it made him a star for such great work as `` deliverance '' .
every character in this film was beautifully defined -
unfortunately ,
to see what the best song was .
to avoid a full-scale panic .
the movie is beautifully shot by kazan ,
the commentary is superb
probably the best
he loved it .
some of the flash forward/back are so so with the lamer character
my favorite character are ben
as a whole great
this is one of the dumbest film ,
is not a single good line or character in the whole mess .
you have not wasted your time
or money do not waste your time ,
but the joy of youth made it very enjoyable .
she suffers far worse condition than leaky plumbing and the occasional water bug ,
`` any movie with beverly d'angelo and sylvia mile as topless cannibal lesbian in leotard can not be all bad '' !
this movie is so childish and stupid '' comment .
i loved cuba in this film .
i also loved
is a perfect example of the triumph
i never realised before of how tedious and bland this cartoon show really was .
it is just plain awful !
it was so terrible .
it was not fun to watch at all .
is not even fun to watch .
maybe then the movie would be enjoyable on a certain level .
this movie ranks alongside i spit on your grave and doom generation in the category of worst movie
unfortunately ,
this lame movie.this movie is incredibly boring ,
the acting is bad
the sound in particular was absolutely dreadful
very disappointing .
there is a great deal of `` steamy '' sex
unfortunately
makes an excellent and intriguing location for mysterious and occult occurrence .
including jean simmon as a frail but beautiful young woman
then i would probably avoid this !
1985 was a good year for film - maybe even great -
such was the academy 's disdain for one of their greatest director ;
( superb ) ,
they tried to avoid the subject of actual computer operation as far
this is by far one of the worst movie i
the poor special effect along with the poor acting
but this one is lame !
but the amazing special effect work
this show is really good and fun to watch .
i rate it 10/10 .
i loved this movie .
what an amazing look at how alien vet feel .
so it was a great film ,
the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately
this sequence ranks among the worst one ever made .
sometimes a bit of a mess.but the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actor .
that however they could avoid in the first movie :
they are going over the top and become annoying .
wonderful actor .
dennis quaid 's character was so poorly written in ,
while probably not the best of all her film ,
this film is fantastic
and have influence over is wonderful .
without the usual cheap thrill most film
but the great one countered with a ddt
but was rock bottomed by the great one and pinned !
but the good earth is one of the worst structured film i have seen in a long time .
and everything is fine and wonderful again .
that poorly written ,
the land is shot beautifully ,
too bad
ably assisted by a solid supporting cast .
this film makes use of some ravishingly beautiful rural scenery ,
but it is an enjoyable spliff ,
and it is full of absurd and ridiculous element
but all the plot hole and the absurd thing make of this a stupid and crappy film.with the exception of the great lena olin ,
all the actor ing bad performances.hayden christensen has zero expression
and the same apply for jessica alba.the extraordinary actor terrence howard is enormously wasted on his role.awake makes a laugh of the spectator.it is so ridiculous and full of absurd thing
it is welcome before too long and becomes stale and tedious
still as bad
it is a comedic gem
you have got mail and feeling disappointed ,
it is a true gem and from this moment one of my favorite movie of all time .
still it is not too bad .
( stone still looks great )
stone is just fantastic here ;
-- this is not at all bad
it was stupid to do a sequel to `` basic ... '' 14 year
but the bell jar is one of my all-time favorite book ,
the worst movie of all time is that it is really not .
there are worse movie out there .
`` house of the dead is however one of the worst film i have ever seen at the theatre .
and you have got a rather pleasant `` picture '' .unfortunately the contrived plot as well
who have enjoyed the glorious color cinematography in `` robin hood ''
will not be disappointed in the fantastic work done here .
but really fails to do so .
is almost just as ridiculous.it may be worth
and you reviewed this film as `` illiant '' or `` fun '' or `` better than the original grease
to the music is obscenely pointless .
all of the music is uncomfortably stupid
3. since michael is beautiful
how a little-seen 2008 film had somehow won the oscar for best picture of 2009
sadly
that this film had won award purely for off-the-screen reasons.the direction and visual style of this film is some of the weakest
annoying `` shaky cam '' visual ,
is some of the worst ever recorded .
just not enough to obscure how bad the project is.the whole film has the feel
and thus re-edited as best they could so as to pass it off as a serious drama.if
and two hour wasted
do not write funny situation ,
this movie was one of the best movie
will be disappointed .
steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person
it is still funny .
ok this movie had a terrible premise .
he makes a bad movie .
i thoroughly enjoyed this movie ,
and ridiculous i had to laugh .
however lame )
i was sad to see mst3k had not done this one .
because nothing could be as bad as `` manos the hand of fate .
it is a fun movie to watch .
smarmy bad guy of the piece.veteran director lamont johnson can not make a silk purse out of this sow 's ear of a script ,
which is stuffed to bursting with howlingly bad dialogue and outlandish situation .
and by far this is the best thing about the movie
obviously shumacher best work in the past 8 year .
but the film fails on the most fundamental level .
it is boring .
the best thing about the dr. jekyll is mr. hyde
but a story this tired needed a kick in the pant and funky new low budget technology
instead it is just a lame retread .
with mainstream fare being enjoyable
and generally light-handed in its judgemant ,
still she does not come off as weak ,
in the 19th century death of a loved one was something a lot more normal than now .
even though the development is not the best .
i highly recommend.8/10
what a disappointment !
although the acting and the production value are not bad ,
the script is awful ,
and the theme is disturbing.the main message of this film is
it is terrible .
excellent production value
not since spongebob squarepant have i seen a greater cartoon on tv .
the color are great ,
great great cartoon .
i love cartoon like this and i hope more person tune in to se this great cartoon .
the only catscratch merchandise available on nick shop is a great lookin shirt
in this glorious telling of a weekend shared among literary great .
describing without boring the viewer
packed with great make up effect and gore .
this movie was a complete waste of time.i viewed this movie with a group of cinematic enthusiast ,
not one of them found a single redeeming quality .
leading to a violent yet unintentionally funny climax
this emerges an innocuous time-waster \u0096 tolerable at just 88 minute but
the ending was wonderful.this movie is in the same category as pakeezah
we were famous for those great show windows
to get them to buy all of that wonderful merchandise.10/10
you were loved by many fan .
it was `` the crocodile hunter '' tv program with bad acting
bad script ,
and bad
how bad the script is ,
avoid this movie like the plague .
avoid this movie !
the great dictator
this beautiful story of an elder son coming home ,
the story is beautiful
and at time funny and comic .
this is a gem !
it is all good fun from those wonderful pre-code day ,
joan looks great
and there are some great montage
great fun !
an insult to anyone 's intelligence ... my roommate was laughing out loud most of the movie
i enjoyed watching this one .
( sounds stupid
my favorite part must be where she rips up her dress
you will not be disappointed !
unfortunately
well too bad .
each subsequent use became laughable
it is funny as all get out .
is the idea behind it.unfortunately
we see the internet get worse by the week-the social networking site or chat room
the story though is so disjointed its boring with it
i loved the movie ,
the movie was great .
when claire dane took the blame ;
she is a great actress.also ,
it was the closing of a great fifty or sixty year period of creativity
but in film it was even a greater period of creativity
but fleischer and cinematographer richard h. kline do a great job
in fact dumbland maybe in for nobody except lynch
and that is what make it funny and a collective cartoon .
dumbland is a wonderful picture of some american
my favorite episode are :
easily one of the ten best movie of the 20th century .
this is one of the ten best work of 20th century cinema
but a thoroughly excellent film .
how is it that so many enjoyed what i consider to be a woefully bad adaptation of my second favourite jane austen novel ?
chintzy mess from opening credit to butchered ending.while many character
the worst by far is paltrow .
i have very much enjoyed her performance in some role ,
an extremely disappointing effort -
though even a perfect emma could not have saved this film .
such great actor such a disappointment .
marlon brando play and awful character ,
the movie is not funny at all ,
a subconscious message can be seen
`` it suucks so badly ! !
avoid at all cost !
awful
once again proving his last great work was `` apocalypse now '' back in the 1970's.what is worse ,
even if it would be no fun to watch ) .
because she was possibly the worst actress i have ever seen in a best picture nominee .
but the line was delivered so poorly i burst out into long
-- they were pretty boring .
part ii gave us the perfect ending .
it was bad to begin with ,
victor burakov played to perfection by stephen rea .
perhaps he is the worst of us gone terribly wrong ?
also does a great job .
all around a very well done movie with fine performance and a great screenplay .
the person *behind* the facts.9/10 star
that is exactly what thomas needs to kick the assistant baddy .
`` this movie is a beautiful
and the movie is 'beautiful
much worse than the original .
dialogue is still bad ,
and music is mediocre .
that reminds of the best work of robert altman and paul thomas anderson .
some great performance by matthias schoenaert
natali brood and the extremely funny duo from ghent
home room was a great movie
it was a great movie .
i loved it so much .
`` dwarf are fun ho ho '' ... )
and definitely amateur in the case of most of the girl ... awful movie .
and you did not bother for any of them.rather bland
vaguely reminiscent of great 1940 's western
excellent cinematography
the expansiveness of the big sky country provides a wonderful setting .
and the acting range from good to excellent
with great performance from dennis hopper and j.t .
labeled as neo-noir
the plot is full of amazing coincidence and improbable timing ,
beyond `` noirish ''
the worst horror movie i have ever seen .
i love bad horror movie ,
at time there is nothing more entertaining than a poorly made slasher flick .
especially since the movie fails to tell you
the best/worst part of this movie
and boy i was right.a great story first of all from a novel and i thought
none of the character actor mentioned earlier can ing this movie out of it is mediocre state
despite some funny moment
this is not a horrible movie ,
it is an amazing coinsidence
that they continued their work during the terrible ordeal
that faced them.a great piece of work .
highly recommended.regard ,
that are actually jumpy/ scary but plenty that are just plain dull.all in all an unpleasant film
and the stunningly beautiful gene tierney is stunningly beautiful !
the humor is subtle
either ( beautiful ) .it is probably not the type of comedy for everyone ,
recommended 110 % .
that does a great job of blending horror and comedy .
cut fails on most level .
not even as a `` so bad it is good '' movie ,
poor acting and a predictable ending are a few of the element
( we do have our gem
who messes up a big delivery of stolen car
routine and of course randall is the best thief
but at time it is predictable too ,
since there are only 50 beautiful
all in all the best way
that mark is bad .
that his film under bruckheimer keep getting worse
8mm was not great ,
because the story was great
and it certainly was worth a look at in the theatre.7/10
one of the worst movie i ever saw .
but it failed miserably to do this.the acting was terrible ,
the story was ridiculous .
it was so predictable .
the mexican accent of the leading lady was insultingly exaggerated
worse than a cartoon .
that this movie is just a cheap knock off of re .
and loved me .
and while the science is all perfectly absurd
and downright laughable
because the movie is thoroughly enjoyable .
the acting is great ,
complete with ray gun and ridiculous science .
what starts off as a typical cowboy/indian western suddenly descends into a very dull romantic 'comedy ' about honus
after enduring well over an hour of poor acting
i bought this movie from best buy
how bad could it be
it is pretty bad .
he is teamed with an `` on-the-edge '' bad cop
but thing turn bad for the guy
ll cool j is terrible in this film .
the ending is far from satisfying.do not waste your time with this film .
and `` walkabout '' is one of my favorite film .
there isa russell is just excellent
she does a wonderful job of exuding the phobia 's and nuance
that this is russell 's best performance and i probably would not argue .
busey also gives a good solid performance
and this is probably their best film together .
to make one of the unfunniest film of all time .
avoid !
that i am a sucker for a beautiful film ,
gojoe provides far more than just beautiful image
it is second greatest strength is superb acting
and a fascinating story with some very dark philosophy .
laying waste to everyone.still ,
the film is definitely one of the most interesting and most beautiful film i have seen for quite some time .
sadly
every major male character is portrayed as weak
boring
the hillbilly chick in the opening sequence is ridiculous
and seems unbelievably random and pointless .
random is also the perfect description for a lot of the camera work
even worse the editing ... sure ,
annoying also attributes the `` music ''
its no fun
the script is a cheap try on `` wrong turn ''
though was delighted with the unexpected australian horror gem .
and found 'cut ' to not only be the best of the genre australia has ever produced ,
but one of the great parody/comedy film of late.my only concern is that mainstream audience may not pick up on a lot of the comedic element -
both performance were fantastic
this movie is one of the best horror product of the last couple or year
as well as a beautiful satire/parody - toungue-in-cheek till the very end.loved it .
when the powers-that-be disowned this waste of celluloid ... the editing is el crapo ,
the plot is incredibly thin and stupid ...
but i do ... and i really feel bad for ron leibman and tom poston
and it is less formal in structure.sadly
-- and often quite terrible .
it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional story
because i had loved the first film so much
to be eaking out into such ridiculous song amidst their misery .
the very cynical and enjoyable `` chicago '' worked on a similar level
something pointless like `` mary poppin '' ) .
the best musical number was probably
to help poor oliver escape the clutch of the evil bill syke ) .
there are other great and classic tune
being a pick-pocket is fun ,
was probably the last of the great film musical
strikes back with the less than perfect ,
( perhaps the best so far around )
a fun horror film for a saturday night .
that the result is laughable .
predictable
this movie is by far one of my favorite .
and leave the movie with a great
( late great anthony franciosa )
and blames it on the poor guy ,
( great genre-mainstay and first time director john saxon )
the jail over.john saxon is a great talented actor
lacks a certain visual flair would be a bit of an understatement .
is just bad enough to be humorous sometimes .
i was pretty disappointed .
i may have enjoyed the film more .
and still remains as the best football player ,
this movie was bad .
this movie was horrible .
the acting was bad .
and they are supposed to look stupid.then
equally insulting is the 60 's horror music
and makes you want to shoot your television.the stupidest part of the movie
word really can not describe how bad this film is .
zandalee was bad ,
this is just laughable !
terrible script
poor direction
- far more enjoyable and much better value for money
it is terrible !
santiago dougla as adrian is excellent .
that has been put into wes anderson 's `` fantastic mr fox '' ,
and make it funny .
and this is the best
and to be perfectly honest look like a bit of a mess .
i can not stress how much of a waste of time this film is .
how she move a near-perfect rating
because the content is truly great .
and amazing dance routines.from
how she move is not perfect of course
that is equally enthralling thank to the amazing talent of the dancer !
and exciting with no slow or boring spot .
the ending is disappointing .
it is not a bad ending
then you will end up disappointed .
and it is one of the best movie of the summer .
rating 8/10
and is married to his beautiful wife gina
nanette may have been dearly loved by her son
in what should have been best picture of the year ,
horrible ninja movie
but it is also an incredibly enjoyable one .
have such horrible dialogue
folks.a terribly fun movie ,
a really very bad movie
vary widely throughout the movie.she and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy
but it is not used to any great effect .
the creepiest scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messy-looking wound of a mouth rapes someone .
there is a laughably and painfully bad scene
all of the x-man movie were great .
they had solid character
( magneto and xavier were the best one
i was so disappointed.hugh jackman is not a bad actor
( his best movie is the fountain ,
the motivation for wolverine are plain stupid
as a great car movie must be getting paid off by daniel sadek
easily the worst automotive movie or any movie ever made .
put in some really crappy special effect and lame character with no relevance
but should remain in the real estate business.this is such a lame movie with such a lame plot and the most contrived action sequence ever .
how did this amazing film
jim shirdan is to me one of the greatest director in the world.the screenplay ,
the music and anything else is excellent in this film .
as everything occurs.ray macanally and brenda fricker are amazing
before my left foot.my left foot was the start of a wonderful period in irish film .
those two performance are two of the best ever film performance
that he is an great actor.this
is an excellent masterpiece in film ,
it was the best ever filmed of the novel .
how disappointed
the scriptwriter have decided to stick in bit of ridiculous humour
which are embarrassing at the best of time ,
and bad guy against each other .
always sound great on paper
sound great does not it ?
it would be great .
it all could have been gore soaked beautiful .
one of the worst movie i have ever seen .
acting was terrible
the lighting was terrible ,
and there were too many mess up about the time of the day
the best acting in the movie was probably from the sheriff
it is not going to be perfect ,
human being are come on that the same like jumping in a fish tank with a great white shark
what a great cheese ball of a premise for a low budget horror movie .
the acting is almost awful except for the actor fortunate enough
but my favorite movie of his is the black cat
it is a great scene .
but this is the worst movie i have ever seen .
but it also has awful cut .
if you want to see the worst movie
or if nothing else is on a good time waster with no
this cast plus a light hearted touch make for a not a great movie but a fun one..on a scale of one to ten ..a 4
leaving oscar a changed and more cleanly individual.jack lemmon as ungar is absolutely superb as the neurotic ,
great actor create a partnership
so great in fact ,
with simon 's amazing script ,
it is excellent script
i just finish watching and i still have bad taste in my mouth .
too much stupid character
( both on a bad way )
who goes unfortunately deeply down under his level with this ,
the rest is so bad ,
it fails to treat the issue
the film fails to reveal what the ld church espouse .
but it would have been great to hear the whole story of joseph smith 's truly interesting life .
hope they do some documentary on this fascinating subject ,
`` moonstruck '' is one of the best film ever .
nichola cage and danny aiello are great
is fantastic .
`` moonstruck '' is an excellent movie for everyone to see and laugh .
a must-see ! 10/10 star !
so that laughably weak premise is the excuse to butcher person in horrible way ,
the twist are laughable ,
you might watch a bad hg lewis film .
it is just god-awful trash ,
who get off on this type of pointless gore ,
i absolutely loved this movie
released in the final part of lar von trier 's fantastic horror satire the kingdom ...
plus a great performance from udo kier in a more substantial role ...
it is just really become annoying to the point
they are still a bit dull though .
i loved
and recommended highly
it on video a year later.it is a great film
but why the poor review for this movie ?
steve martin should have been nominated for best supporting actor as a movie producer
if you loved magnolium
i liked this movie a lot.i rented this expecting something not too bad
not intended to be just a stupid slapstick comedy
and involving and has a refreshing feel to it .
you wont be disappointed to watch this .
because it is so terrible .
that child are stupid and are excellent for absorbing endless ad
because it is slapstick funny .
( badly )
you do not get a refund .
after i was told the no-refund policy ,
that was made into a beautiful and moving movie !
that was awful ,
so i enjoyed revolver .
the acting was superb from all the main actor
was great.though a step below such movie as
that the special effect were bad would be a disservice to the field of special effect .
spare me the cheap attempt at sci-fi
it is a tour de force of bad sci-fi -
also pretty much fulfills one of my longtime bad movie contention - bad guy always wear sunglasses.if this were not 2005 ,
this film was some sort of insanely poor metaphor for the cold war .
tom is wasting the bad sunglass guy with his never-ending banana clip
that even in the worst of science fiction we can all find something to laugh about .
`` a chorus line '' is arguably the best musical in theatre .
and is arguably the worst film adaptation of a broadway musical ,
the very beautiful `` hello twelve
'' a song so bad
which deserved far greater respect than this sad effort .
and she is great at playing the innocent victim .
and even ron howard used a variation in a beautiful mind .
there are no redeeming quality to revolver .
and might even outdo his wretched remake of swept away as his worst film yet .
this film is full of bad scripting and laughable moment .
then he is a bad dude .
then they writer or director goes out his way for a bad ending .
that is right a bad ending ,
cheaply i might add and chases her out .
then as she is walking home ala funhouse .
some of my favorite wrestling moment took place on this stage .
johnny b. badd
he was great.-dirrty
i am not going to waste my time
writing an essay and waste your time .
are being totally ridiculous .
johnnymacbest
it simply goes around the corner and becomes ridiculous .
i fast-forwarded as much as i could and still i could not get rid of the boring moment .
is not that amazing ?
and the `` tooth-fairy '' was lame .
the acting throughout is excellent - no question .
peter egan as the lead magnus pym is excellent.the film portrayed the life of a traitor .
its worst then resident evil .
bad acting crap .
it is bad as crudy vs gayson .
absolutely the most boring movie i have ever spent my money on.this was a wrong choice for all these great star
to waste their reputation on .
boring !
boring !
boring !
who have left me disappointed at the way
`` running with scissors '' leads the public to anticipate great acting in a film
that film viewer are pretty much acquainted with her solid and reliable style of acting .
this girl was the part.it is a great movie
i was not disappointed .
and no one could have played this role to perfection
this one is boring
cheap
there was not one boring bit in it
equally great was charlotte gainsbourg
i had a great afternoon
due to the frequently superb acting and dialogue
i avoided this at the cinema
and it is much worse than other mj movie like `` the wiz ''
it has to get a 7/10 from me .
i have been familiar with the fantastic book of 'goodnight mister tom ' for absolutely age
'goodnight mister tom ' was an extremely poor adaption
and practically 4.5/10 of the book was missed out .
that a lot of the character and some great scene in the book were not in this .
i absolutely loved this film !
that there were so many perfect choice
where the film could have gone for the cheap thrill ,
and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thriller
i loved this show so much .
it is funny
lauren character is so funny
and ameche do a wonderful job with the voice of chance
and the acting by the animal themselves is just amazing.i have seen this movie 72 time already
it is indeed my all-time favorite movie !
the repeated blowing up of the beautiful house in the middle of a desert
and superb screenplay .
it was a great film
the lead pair were not great actor
played wonderfully by frank morgan .
as well.this is a wonderful
it was because the movie was badly written ,
why anyone waste money
it was beautifully done
it is fantastic on more level than i can remember .
and is also a great tutorial on how to relate to your partner .
this superb tale of revenge
has only one weak spot i can think of :
( versatile at playing both good guy and bad guy )
the showdown between stewart and mcnally on the cliff is great !
was neither funny or rather dramatic .
he was supposed to be making fun of ,
destroyed by the poor lack of funny comedy .
but sadly the execution is what ultimately hurt this film .
sadly
attempt to be funny ,
while speak a message about the film industry falter .
to help spice up this dull story .
to even ing the worst out even in this entertaining family .
but these typically funny comedian were obviously underused
that townsend had to pull from that hollywood shuffle would have been funny
sadly
townsend can be funny ,
we are threaded through a weak story ,
this was rather disappointing to watch .
that it is going to work perfectly ,
i loved this movie !
but i really enjoyed myself .
world at war is the best wwii documentary
it has great music and narrator .
all-in-all i gave this one 10/10 ,
and we spent an hour afterward exclaiming over how bad it was.warning :
they want her to marry a boring guy their own age
she decides to marry the boring guy .
that the boring guy
it is that bad .
i left out the part about the cancer red-herring and the harpy 's ridiculous lesbian moment .
it is fascinating how both story line keep intertwining with each other .
disorganized crime is one very funny caper movie
rarely have i felt the need
complete with the requisite abusive husband and dull suburban existence .
that almost all content in this dull movie is completely hackneyed and trite .
montford 's pathetic attempt at symbolism
is laughable.when
everything is completely predictable and uninvolving .
being as stupid
and the inclusion of joy division on the soundtrack of this wretched film is insulting.the part
and it is not as bad as 'btk killer
' the ultimate marker for judging any terrible film .
but this film is just as bad
with great energy .
he is given a lame
pointless script
he attempts a lame jerry lewis act and fails miserably .
peter berg is wasted in a thankless role
peter falk is also wasted ,
though he has a few funny line
that is too much talent too waste on a clunker like `` corky romano . ''
and it is made worse by kattan 's hammy acting .
it is bad enough
that is funny
it is a hell of a lot worse .
but i am not gon na waste my time .
if you predicted bad thing from the trailer
'they all laughed ' is a superb peter bogdanovich
the fantastic soundtrack
who is superb .
and ritter fall for beautiful dorothy stratten
full moon has a number of awful film ,
but this has got to be the worst .
they seemed to have just wasted a lot of time
which is simply horrible .
horrible casting .
his `` crying '' is actually funny ,
and his madman antic are even funnier .
is just as bad ,
can anyone say pathetic ?
they were laughable .
but it looked more like cheap zombie makeup for halloween.this movie is just horrible from the start .
the story is stupid and very
do not waste your time on this piece of garbage .
this film is a triumph for loesser 's amiable and subtle lyric
truly enjoyed it .
then some bit might be funny in a sad kind of way ,
it does not even qualify as a so-bad-it is-good movie .
it is just plain bad .
very bad .
who you do not want to mess with ' message behind the ingenious scene .
we already have our ultra-evil bad guy ,
that only poor action film can accomplish
the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie ,
that a lame movie must have .
so now for the best bit
to convey the message
that actually enjoyed the movie to whoop a few time .
bad guy
michael dougla and kiefer sutherland did their best to inject some reality into the story -
disappointing on the whole despite some very good scene .
i did not like the idea of the female turtle at all since 1987 we knew the tmnt to be four other with their teacher splinter and their enemy and each one of the four other are named after the great artist name like leonardo
but to have a female turtle is a very weak point
why do person bitch about this movie and not about awful movie like the godfather .
titanic is the greatest movie of the 21st century.with great acting ,
and sadly one of the most underrated movie i have ever seen .
apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time .
that is almost cheap-looking enough for ed wood .
audience gave it the bad reception it richly deserved .
wender was great with million $ hotel.i do not know
who is actually at the level of stupidity
.the character are not well shaped.and the most important thing is the idea that is given with religion is somehow funny to me.at the ending scene
that gets 10/10 is that sentence.but it is wasted behind this film making .
they are just the `` poor '' and the `` hopeless '' one
the dialog throughout the film was just horrible .
and topped with the cherry of horrible acting as only a porn star could deliver .
and all the beautiful car
then picked up his lead from hollywood 's unemployment line.and the script.yikes.it mystery science theatre 3000 bad.this is 70 's made for tv movie bad.yeah ,
and the action is directed so poorly you can not get excited by the chase ,
avoid redline like bad cheese .
are just born bad '' ,
this house was not born bad but rather became bad
was absolutely ridiculous .
the original nel was not a bad person ,
and the script was so poorly written
one of the worst cheap horror flick i have ever seen ...
the movie actually stars the less than amazing kim oja as a stewardess
who is 'surprisingly ' overlooked by the five hijacker ,
more commonly known as kenny bania from `` seinfeld '' .i can not forget to leave out my favorite part of the movie ,
to blow a lock off a door ... brilliant.the plot
was unnaturally predictable.the script - atrocious .
would make a stupid comment ,
the only thing special about this movie is that i wasted the cost of electricity
just because it is bad .
and the stupidity of them in the film is too questionable .
example is the poor
who likes to watch some awful death and practically torture .
one of the great mystery of life
is why nice girl so often are more interested in the jerk and heel than in the nice guy.worse ,
and he is perfect in the role
intended to be bad guy
full of spoilers.this is a pretty fast and enjoyable crime thriller
it to broadway.it is a lot of fun for a number of reason .
and fred jone are superb .
dyan cannon gives a pitch-perfect performance as the anxious wife
the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately
this sequence ranks among the worst one ever made .
sometimes a bit of a mess.but the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actor .
that however they could avoid in the first movie :
they are going over the top and become annoying .
'a smile like your ' is a pathetic comedy
she is quite a boring character
no interest.they are the two most boring and often annoying character ,
( although joan cusak is pretty funny in the restaraunt scene ) .danny
but her character is too predictable ,
it is stupid
the overall movie itself is utterly boring ,
the main character are completely boring .
let alone funny.joan cusak should have been in the lead
cusak would 've made even a lousy story outrageously funny
the performance in this film are so dull
what is worse is that it is colored like an episode of miami vice .
you will feel like a pampered weakling after watching these person herd their animal through ice cold water and walk barefoot through the snow
the priest is played by jame `` roscoe p. coltrane '' best
establishing and transition shot in great quantity ,
this film is another in a series of huge disappointment ... most of these so-called `` master of horror '' film are only horrifying in term of their sub-par effect and laughable story line ... aside from ron perlman ,
( which was unfortunately cut from the televised version i saw ) ,
this movie has a great deal more to recommand it.sidney bruhl
to add insult to injury
an absolute masterpiece of suspense and mystery.the acting is excellent .
caine gives his usual excellent performance ,
reeve also gives an excellent rendering of a man
but the movie i will probably see many time.thi film is unforgettable with perhaps the richest imagery i have ever seen in a movie .
i loved this
i thoroughly enjoyed it ,
provoking message just plain good fun entertainment
highly recommended to those of us
and not dissect them great fun for all the family here .
she is excellent and very sultry .
the song like one boy and one last kiss are really enjoyable to listen to and to tap your foot to jason alexander is the complete contrast to his character in pretty woman ans is very good .
overall i just loved it
and share their reaction to this horrible incident ...
but in all fairness it is watchable and rather funny .
it is just a stupid film about a serial killer
who gets doused in a load of toxic waste
this film is really stupid
but it is funny .
this is not my favorite wip
but it is fun to see how hard he try to put this film above your average chicks-in-chains flick .
while there were some funny part
the funniest joke were unexpected and over very quickly ,
there were some poor scene transition ,
i loved this movie .
and everyone loved it .
they loved it !
this move was great .
we have loved and lost .
great direction
and superbly acted .
who have lost a loved one
this is a cute animation loved very much through my eye as a child .
because i am a huge thriller fan.i was not disappointed .
the acting was superb
but young adam and young fenton were excellent .
it was beautifully shot.one must also note the plot twist .
even though i have re-watched the film so many times.a true gem .
but her problem are about to get a whole lot worse .
every character is extremely sympathetic
but she is not stupid .
but he also has great comedy skill.nigel cole finds the perfect tone for `` saving grace . ''
kamal amrohi is one of the rare poet of cinema
this movie is just great .
pacino does a great job
and make it sound just great .
it is really just that great .
but that it makes you actually root for the bad guy ...
to give a perfect answer ,
not even beautiful but just a plain-looking woman with tinted skin ,
annoying - my ears may bleed
not if she did her best !
it is also highly poor and
this movie is just not funny .
josh kornbluth is the antithesis of funny ,
my god this movie is awfully boring .
and some great performance from gershon .
gershon is great as always ,
her best film so far .
the plot was pretty lame
that this was a pretty stupid movie .
d 3/10
that the character were in i most definitely give this movie a 10/10 .
the film was bad would be a missed opportunity
.one to be avoided .
and sees the perfect creepy ,
and he was fun to watch .
refreshing view of relationship today .
with the usual bad dubbing
but the movie is one of the best of its kind ,
this is a great movie
it plays like a dean koontz book.bill paxton 's performance was great
( this is the best thing
and it is beautifully acted.as the eponymous mother anne reid betrays her wasted life in every gesture .
caught up in a messy affair with the man her mother seduce
and even messier life ,
the film is also extremely beautiful
and that the writing was good but not great .
kind of pathetic in a likable way .
and justin lane were excellent as the roommate
was by far my favorite ;
and very funny .
but none of it was bad .
ridiculous and funny.i am giving this one high mark ,
but unfortunately his good film are just gem amongst heap of crap and devil hunter is very much a part of the crap .
especially in the funnel scene ) .
damon shine and really has proved a very solid actor ,
excellent film all in all and a fantastic ending to an amazing trilogy.p.s .
the entire thing so ridiculous
well the hollywood mogul have got a lot more ridiculous and foul-smelling stuff for you to swallow .
plot is weak ,
what a waste of time
much more stupidity of that same kind is going on and on leaving the audience wondering
which just turned out to be a bad one .
such a waste of time even to try and write about this low-low supposed-to-be `` movie '' .
the ending was so funny
leslie mann also had some incredibly funny moment .
funny film
and enjoy the great soundtrack .
i especially enjoyed the orb 's version of jimmy cliff 's vietnam and the tower of london 's take on freebird .
you will not be disappointed .
i am able to embark into the past of all the great star trek episode .
-- `` i like the next generation '' the best .
granted datum from tng is great
not only is picardo such a great actor but the premise
that is science fiction at its best !
which are blessed with 2 beautiful woman right from 1st episode ,
what a great job !
and the chemistry between the actor is amazing .
but ashanti does not even have that going for it.what an incredible waste of time .
as good as it is ever going to look unless anchor bay gets a hold of it.the gore truly stands out like it should and you can really appreciate the excellent makeup and gore fx.the sound is also terrific.it is only 2 channel dolby
and the effective although cheap sound effect.it never sounded so good
and the excellent transfer adds to the overall enjoyment.i never realized just how much blood flows in this film
especially of the italian kind.there is some excellent set piece and cinematography to be found ,
the dubbing is horrible
but that is part of it is charm.to me this is one of the best horror film ever made ,
you can not make a film this bad
excellent set design
sometimes great cinematography
wonderfully cheesy acting
great makeup effect
beautiful woman
excellent music
instead he makes one of the worst movie
and not to mention the bad cgi used on making the monster .
a little lame .
honestly this is one of the worst movie
the action is terrible
that is the best thing
'' a leaden soap opera with almost terminally bland performance by ingrid bergman
featuring a fascinating performance by will smith and a story
which i also loved .
that this show was poorly produced as well
and make the best of it .
that there is after all a great deal of true production integrity and value out there
the story line is a scrambled mess ,
there is a lot of wasted talent and time here .
beautiful cinematography in a collaborative effort by william fritzsche and bill daniel .
and the script is quite weak ,
if you like low-budget horror film give this one a look.8/10 .
a dreadfully predictable ending to boot .
she blames not only her dysfunctional relationship but also her messed up life on her poor mother.though you may think
badly of this woman ,
beautifully
this character has dimension and portrays great emotion.a truly illiant performance and an enjoyable film.8/10
despite not being one of the best disney works .
great character
`` the age of not believing '' and `` the beautiful briny sea '' are the very best .
`` portobello road '' is nice too.david tomlinson is great in this film once again .
angela lansbury is great as miss price
even funnier is whenever professor emelius browne is transformed into a white rabbit because ,
but its ending is quite bad .
in great part because the animated knight thing is a little too much for me
sergio martino is a great director ,
my personal favorite of the martino film i have seen
as `` la coda dello scorpione '' is an equally excellent film
the case of the scorpion 's tail '' excellently deliver all the element a great giallo need .
regular giallo leading-man george hilton once again deliver an excellent performance in the lead .
the includes the great luigi pistilli
another great actor
is actually a great setting for a giallo .
and the photography great
`` la coda dello scorpione '' is another excellent giallo from sergio martino and an absolute must-see for any lover of the sub-genre !
and great in all regard !
it is alway nice to watch neatly captioned scene from great movie
what makes the movie such fun to watch is the unanswerable question
delivering perfect english in most crazy way ,
is a perfect void ,
and this `` osama witch project '' is the hands-down worst film i have seen this year
worse than even `` catwoman '' -
even the cheap-ass/no class terminator knock-off `` class of 1999 '' is more entertaining than this !
what the poor woman sees in this guy
his acting was so bad ,
perhaps the worse casting in the history of hollywood .
if it was just as excellent as remember
this is one of the best reunion special ever
and having fun
except maybe for the surprisingly many different location throughout europe .
the ending is hugely disappointing .
and how the world all fits together.the best part of this film are some of the line
that it passes 90 or so minute in a 'fun ' way
it is a total waste of time and money .
the movie is so bad
everything in it is bad .
actor were bad .
script was really bad .
and the worst cgi ever .
he is so stupid
the film never got boring the plot
the acting was fun to watch
and the action was quite fun as well especially the climax gary busey makes a good hero ironic
to finish it of plato 's run is an enjoyable effort from nu image film
and i give it 7/10
my son loved every minute of this film ,
because of its beautifully illustrated scenery and its non-stop excitement !
10/10 hidden frontier crew.make
but -atlantis- represents one of the worse film in that motif .
the character are weak .
that each member trots out seems stock and awkward at best .
while the character were thin at best ,
the best part about -atlantis- was the voice talent .
funny line
was the worst .
the plot was bad .
the script and the animation is peppered with annoying sloppiness .
it must be the spirit of the crystal beaming message to the surface .
when the cataclysm of stupidity set in -- but any of it **hardly** qualifies her father for deification ! !
atlantis is no longer a weak power ,
and avoided so much badness.4/10
-- the movie is enjoyable
this `` thing '' is just an awful sequence of extremely short cut of blurry camera work .
the story is so badly told
it is just an extremely stupid idea .
this combined with the awful ,
i am sorry for the wasted effort of the main actor ,
what makes for best picture material ?
that have aged poorly ,
is a great bit of characterisation ,
which does not really have as many great routine or memorable set-piece as an american in paris ,
it certainly is a great show .
but transcends its roots thank to excellent casting ,
but he is the best man for the job
perettus and luque are excellent together and remind me of screen team terence hill and bud spencer ,
a wonderful and very entertaining action comedy
nor insults your intelligence .
that the use of a child with limited dancing ability in the title role is not a cheap stunt
and they have been put in as a cheap concession simply to appease unsophisticated audience
and the worst aspect of his make-up is that it is still recognizably his face ,
how wonderfully creative baryshnikov 's nutcracker mask was - the `` jaws '' actually seemed to move whenever baryshnikov tilted his head back.the dancing itself in the macaulay culkin version is excellent
unlike the weak 'elvira 's haunted hill ' ... anyway i love the way
beautifully photographed
though sympathetic and lovely to look at
`` one of the cinema 's few perfect actress
before i returned to my normally favorite chair to subject myself to more torture.dean morgan
but this one was just plain bad.the good part :
when she ran.the bad part :
bad acting
a total waste of $ 6 and time .
is by no means a bad film ,
the film actually works best as a touristy video
but too mundane and slightly boring ,
this is a *bad* movie .
the worse it gets simply due to the fact
and this movie portrays it very poorly .
but i found it to be shockingly bland from almost the very beginning .
to be anything but - a lame
extremely boring drama disguised as a thought-provoking action sci-fi flick .
pass it up for kitamura 's far more enjoyable freshman effort `` versus '' or his 2004 riot `` godzilla :
as all of you are as funny
and awful actor to boot.the main gag in the film is one of the character shouting
which is funny
tedious and dare i say very plain woman leads in the film.the worst film i have seen in year ,
and hopefully never see one as bad again ,
( my favorite jame bond )
a poor orphaned 18-year-old girl
`` this book is amazing ''
its beautiful language
and surprisingly fresh
and it was a wonderful experience .
this version is still my favorite `` jane eyre '' film .
to be funny .
the third was just flimsy enough to be funny .
rating it even as much as average.this makes my list of the 10 worst movie of all time .
and nearly pointless .
but it seems to be a lousy excuse
do not waste your time with this movie ;
the opening sequence had a terrible rock song .
during this terrible rock song
it is a sadly routine slasher film
with a ghost face killer and some really terrible joke .
yeah ... this is not a `` so-bad-it is-good '' movie ,
it is just bad.someone compared this to a troma film ,
is horrible .
not horrible in a troma sense --
would have saved this film from bad acting .
that seems a bit contrived and is hardly subtle .
8/10 .
the storyteller at his very best .
that you`ve had a great time .
an amazing work.thomas mccarthy
`` houseboat horror '' is often regarded as the worst australian film ever made
as they are attempting to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the australian outback.badly acted
and written slasher flick with zero suspense and annoying characters.it certainly delivers the gore :
but you have been warned.at least it is better than swedish `` the bleeder '' .4/10 .
the plot line of no one sleeps is not a bad idea ,
why is the sound so bad ? ''
this film is so bad ,
poorly produced
( and a damn funny one at that )
the set are laughable
the effect so bad
that they are not even laughable ,
it always ridiculous
pointless but undoubtedly compelling late-night feature .
oh fun !
are solid ,
it was not the best re-cap episode i have every seen
a great potential indie film or big budget drama .
mason gamble is great
that remains of the story plays out like a bad after school special .
poor person = good ,
rich person = bad .
and ( unfortunately )
filled with wonderful song and a spectacular performance by bara ,
presented as 'festive fun '
it is funny ,
and it is superbly written .
plays his part perfectly
that his own lot is not so bad.this film has fewer weak or dud scene
it correct every time.i particularly loved the drama scene ,
she is beautiful and single ,
great !
that it is still a great power after world war ii .
so that it becomes weighed down and unfunny .
the script is too poor
and some of the greatest comedy talent
raymond huntley and john le mesurier - are criminally wasted.terry-thomas
this movie was great !
it was an excellent rendition of an ancient myth .
but that was perfect for the movie .
that needed the character to bust into song.perfect .
10/10 .
makes other so called comedy like dead boring .
one of the best of all time !
trey parker and matt stone play their role as loser with apt perfection .
this is a great film .
jr. does some of his best work to date as brashear .
this is an awfully cramped and claustrophobic feature ;
mostly for lost opportunity and bad career move .
too bad ,
i avoided this film like the plague
it was one of my favorite show .
a wonderful film to watch with astonishing scene and talented actor
but it is also one of the best film
it is still wonderfully written
is excellent .
this catiii film is highly recommended .
the acting was poor .
the character were unsympathetic.the best scene
and found it awful .
he was just awful ,
this series is just awful to show us the truth ,
a somewhat awkward spy mystery with a predictable plot about world war two danger .
the best acting is done by raymond massey as dr. ingersoll ,
that the casting has to be ranked as one of the worst in film history .
i absolutely loved it ,
but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music .
which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box-set.unfortunately i feel
they have made some pointless alteration ,
but worst of all i feel
which i find annoying in many disney film.this film still blows away most recent animated film ,
which is sadly missing from most modern mass-market
accused of the most dreadful of act .
is a showing of great emotional strength
the entire support cast are also excellent ,
with director of photography ian baker capturing this great land with splendour
and bruce smeaton 's music is perfect for the part .
and i am disappointed
the character really have great personality
not so great ,
but they are still funny ! ) .
the range of different type of person is great .
my favorite character must be mr.aoki .
it is a perfect movie with wonderful dancing .
unfortunately we never get the chance to see them go to blackpool .
in general home ward bound 1 and 2 are the best movie i
it is a great movie for the whole family .
once controversial adaptation of jeffrey konvitz ' best-seller ,
( not an entirely bad thing
it is an enjoyable movie
i can not really think of any redeeming feature of this utterly bad rendering on asimov than the art direction .
this was not only laughable and but painful to watch .
even the action was boring .
a mixture of mtv inspired production value and utterly bad dialogue probably aimed at very small children.what a shame
that sci-fi this bad can still be made
truly awful .
one of the most provocative film ever with excellent cinematography
played by eva longorium clearly loved the movie and role
lol.the best part of the movie would have to be without a doubt
was acted to perfection !
it just seems a pitiful way to remember such wonderful character .
it is all rather disappointing.one feel
i am appalled at how bad this film is .
i would see a film worse than those 2. granted
there is the horrible casting :
you will also be disappointed .
this fantastic whodunit is an early prototype
what really makes this movie fun to watch
that he was one of the best hollywood director .
highly recommended
it is film-noir at its best
its amazing
what a fun b-movie !
shepis is absolutely beautiful
this is truly a b-movie gem .
i enjoyed this film
is the best ww ii documentary ever produced .
most of the time it was treated as a tax shelter or a cheap way
for canadian 8/10 for the rest of the world 5/10 .
i was in absolute awe of this beautiful lady .
as they did in this wonderful movie .
she was the most beautiful creature
the writer of the greatest hero of the bible should have at least paid closer attention to the chronology of biblical person and event .
would not it be great
if not another teen movie actually put an end to all of these stupid
pointless ,
in a perfect world
yet this one is even worse .
yet it is `` funny . ''
is just plain dull in this movie .
that he is not the best director of all time ,
that winner has somehow managed to round up a simply amazing cast of talent more than makes up for it .
the cast list is truly superb
with the relatively unknown cristina raine heading up a great support cast .
whose resume is stuffed with some of the best work of the genre ,
she is great with the fighting
unfortunately
filmed on the cheap
the weak satire capitalize on american ' then-fresh fever for the new age of technology ,
it showed great potential .
it was disappointing
and it is the worst clich\u00e9d
which would have been better for the audience and saved us from two hour of the worst acting i have seen to date .
it was recommended to me by a friend with mediocre taste in movie ,
by god is it awful .
is just plain awful .
by being so bad at point
the isabel girl was pretty godawful too ,
although it is obvious the direction was bad
and the father was not half-bad to my memory ,
predictable story
the editing was probably the worst i have seen ,
and here is my favorite part .
and as bad
( my four year old loved it ) ,
cary grant and myrna loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple
and an explosion of the original budget.there are many great laugh
be more funny than eddie murphy .
the movie is really bad and the performance of the girl
really bad
that this work it is incredibly bad.the first thing
awful story and terrible performance .
and the excellent santo and johnny song
unfortunately
the film turns funny for no apparent reason !
what a waste .
soderburgh does an excellent job
the acting was as bad as re-enactment scenario on the `` fbi file '' show
the worst re-enactment
even after bad movie i feel
or enjoyed some aspect ,
though the character were utterly boring .
which are 95 % of the film _by some of the best
perfect for doing a drill in keat 's 'negative capacity '
one of the best documentary released in recent year .
which eventually got the message back to venezuela by cable tv.14 .
whom only a referendum could constitutionally replace.8.9/10 - at a little over an hour long ,
makes a great companion piece to `` the battle of algier ''
this is the best movie i
this movie was wonderfully plotted
that was funny
even though there is a pointless aspect to the film
it is well acted.the performance of depardieu and dewaere are very enjoyable.they have a good chemistry together
that it was a bad movie .
the movie was terrible at editing .
the direction was not bad ,
what is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date .
nana patekar was excellent as her father-in-law .
deepti naval as the mother-in-law was excellent especially in her final scene .
sanjay kapoor was all right ,
shahrukh khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role .
only because it came at the worst moment ever .
damroo bhaje was boring and nothing to rave about .
dil ne pukara is too boring of a song
despite the poor editing ,
this program is a lot of fun
sophomoric and pretentious in the worst way .
the worst offender were the crack-pot charlatan ramtha and joseph dispenza .
i saw this dull waste of time on hbo 's comedy channel
but there is absolutely nothing funny here .
a good cast is basically wasted on a script
as it has some of the most dull ,
pointless dialogue i have come across in a while
that i really enjoyed the film very much .
while other trashy junk out there does.it is great to see falk with a big leading man role again
is a funny
this cannon movie tale is the worst of the lot ,
is made to look so stupid ,
beckinsale performance was a little weak though .
and i give it a 7/10 .
it lacks surprise
the coffee slogan is a lousy thing
and the ending is thoroughly predictable .
it handled the time travel theme and the avoidance of paradox
-- the art direction was really great ,
and they both delivered amazing performance here .
the acting seemed solid
despite some pretty solid performance by the actor ,
it is not one of allen 's best
but it is far better than his worst.the acting is
allen is bad
but johansson and jackman are just great
-- they look fantastic
is great and in perfect sync with the film 's variation .
jada is a wonderful additive to the cast and sandler pull tear .
and was a great supporter for sandler.i see oscar somewhere here .
but this is a great film regardless
one of arnold 's best .
he does what he does best in the action man role ,
dawson is perfectly irritating as the tv presenter ,
ridiculous act or violence or just a good action film .
poor well-dressed errol flynn
unfortunately
as an excellent actor .
overlooked as great performance
it really become laughable at points.of course
the movie also does not feature the best actor ,
that casper van dien really is not a bad 'action hero ' and actor ,
it is not the worst genre movie i have ever seen
but it also are not exactly the most original or memorable one either.4/10
that the entire beloved cast of other rendition would constantly join in the action .
it is ridiculous ,
uninteresting and pointless.every episode ends with robotboy winning
excellent cast
there is also some great f/x
is now utter gibberish and very laughable to all person
thereafter i would not waste my time .
this has got to be one of the worst fillum i
boring
the nicholas cage character is so badly drawn
that he was in the worst movie of his entire career .
a great example of this is the rewrite of the boarder crossing
my perspective on holm 's performance was that he portrayed the disorientation of samson during his wife 's defection excellently and i believe
i have seen a lot of stupid movie in my life
the worst one ever !
has horrible acting
lame porn music throughout the whole thing
i would have to compare the lameness of this movie to the like of `` twin dragon '' ,
do not even waste your time .
i found this movie to be very funny ,
i loved
and since i am a sport fan i loved
how they made fun some of the more ridiculous thing in sport .
this movie is great for non sport lover too ,
if this style of comedy is not your favorite
is an excellent romance with a nice twist
( a surprisingly game candice bergen ) .
( with the predictable argument
the acting is so bad
it is not even funny ,
that i had wasted 1hour 21 minute
avoid at all cost .
to write and paint in this incredible 1989 film .
great script and wonderful direction by jim sheridan help to paint a vivid portrait of christy brown
one of the greatest actor in the world -
funny and loving .
nothing at all.brenda fricker is amazing as christy 's mother ,
the wonderful thing about fricker 's performance is that the support
but this is an amazing achievement by all involved and a must-see .
who finds this film boring is a hopeless bonehead
and does not have a boring moment .
because the singular non-homicidal element is a second-rate bland awful-acting 'wes bentley ' mopester .
perhaps a greater emphasis on societal rejuvenation through blood intake ,
character development and story development are lacking ... unfortunately ,
( and that poorly presented )
but honestly it was a frustrating and disappointing waste of an hour and a half .
trio 's vignette were insightful and quite enjoyable .
the performance and attention to detail were wonderful to watch.observation .
but it was much worse .
the twin sister are two of the most annoying celeity around ,
this is awful gush of rubbish film .
pretty poor !
all the character become unsympathetic and unlikable
the only redeeming feature of the film for me was a rare appearance from ken campbell
unfortunately the only one evident in the film .
one of the great classic comedy .
a fun
a buyer beware guide to a new home.filled with great character
this was not bad .
the spot were amazing .
i enjoyed it .
unfortunately
the stupid fan did not care for this .
reaction was disappointing .
creative screwed up again.a stupid diva thing is next .
that is refreshing .
lame .
a few other were solid .
smackdown is not a bad show
and enjoyed it very much .
paul linder make an excellent combination finding eccentric miachel bate
was a perfect casting decision in the movie and for the movie .
my favorite cast member was sandy ryan played by the magnificent and underrated dea kara unger with her own special performance again in the movie within the movie .
is not that great ,
for me `` the legend of zu '' is perfectly transparent .
it is a really beautiful film !
that probably would have been best.i noticed the presence of lindsay crouse and jay thomas - both very good performer -
unfortunately
to waste an hour or so .
if not always the best ,
derek jacobi as claudius is superb
and while the other three actor do a great job
but this piece of trash insult me to no end .
first of all the movie is starring lizzy mcguire 's other as the annoying little kid
but redeeming quality to this movie were
that it was so bad
me the bad acting made me wish for death .
the only thing worse then the acting was the end of course the hero spend
this was a superb movie .
the acting performance were great
and the script was equally great.helen hunt was magnificent as the riverside police officer gina pulasky .
and marc price was great in this film .
this is one of the funniest movie i
and start a huge and ridiculous fire fight is one of the most incredibly funny stupid action movie moment of my life .
and consider it a great classic with great veteran actor .
except the radio and the starting out of great film being made in hollywood .
it seems very corn ball and stupid ,
and 30 's and they were a great generation
that loved good family film .
... this is a wonderful film
with a great cast
jack lemmon and walter matthau wording a perfect script by neil simon ,
based on his play.it is real to life situation done perfectly .
that it will be as funny and fresh a hundred year from now .
that sequel were never made.10/10-ld_________my faith :
it was very funny .
i also fun
because it sucked bad !
but the story is too ridiculous for word .
you will be disappointed ,
if someone asked me to do bad acting just to give me a few buck
where do i sign up ? overall boring and laughable horror .
the movie had a little bit of a weak 1st act with some forced acting and a somewhat disjointed rhythm and pacing
it is just functional ,
but the execution was lackluster with mediocre direction ,
and you can get the movie for very cheap as well
you might not want to waste your time
unless you can get the mst3k version to at least get some laugh out of it .
doghi is a wonderful movie
and renuka daftardar is excellent .
who is usually excellent in most of her role .
its an example of marathi cinema at its best .
where the social message is hammered in .
the movie is a poor copy of hollywood blockbuster love actually.my suggestion .
this movie is not perfect .
there are some great absurdist moment ,
is excellent .
10/10
it took paul reiser 20 year to write this beautiful romance/comedy.actor :
10/10 well you can not say anything else
a perfect outcome
it is no wonder this movie is that perfect
as the son paul reiser does an excellent job ,
although he is not a great actor
actually peter falk and paul reiser plays the perfect father and son
10/10 it does not always work
the music is perfect in tune ,
a great soundtrack for a romance/comedy thats for sure.overall :
10/10 there are so many romance/comedy movie out on tape
a great piece
it became one of my all-time favorite movie .
i hope with great anticipation
try to be funny and fails miserably .
the animation is just terrible ,
plot is dull and cliched .
but do not waste hard earned money
to pay to see it.1/10
though it is by no means the worst of its type you will ever see .
- the beautiful `` victim
having come to their premise with only the worst of intention ,
i saw this film in the worst possible circumstance .
who 'd won best actress at canne for the role .
he has achieved one of those rare monumantal work of art in the cinematographic world
a wonderful funny pitiful laughable loving frightened beautiful personality
the cuasi-surrealist scene fit in perfectly :
which i consider an excellent film ,
11/10
the indescribably annoying french woman
but is really just stupid .
when her mental health takes a turn for the worse .
and an insidious message
and it is great !
the film is wonderful
this film is sexy and excellent !
this film has to be the worst i
with the acting so poor you just have to cringe .
yeah its fun to fantasize ,
this was just terrible and corny and terrible at being corny .
unless you are five or like terrible movie ,
dreadful .
but marsden was terrible
the moment of half-escape were not thrilling but irritating and weak .
dragon hunter has to be the best-looking animated film i
so uniquely beautiful ,
i love to praise a great movie and i am not biased toward `` male '' movie .
legally blonde was an excellent film .
weak ,
poorly written ,
making at its worst .
this story is weak
even if i ignore the poorly written story ,
every character was a mess .
georgia was a horrible mother ,
her daughter was a horrible mother and daughter ,
and lohan was a horrible excuse for a human
late richard farnsworth 's performance is one of the reasons.8/10
frederick elme 's camerawork keeps one interested in the dull bit
this film is the worst film
the story line is weak -
the editing is horrible .
associated with this waste of film .
do not waste your time
this was one of the first and best of the american punk rock movie ,
originally the producer wanted cheap trick as the star ,
but the fan always loved
is stupid fun with some classic ramone footage in their heyday .
it is great fun ,
i watched the whole tedious thing
and built expectation for a huge redeeming payoff .
unlike urban legend the screenplay and the story line is very weak .
and that is what makes valentine the best .
everybody has loved the soundtrack as far as i know .
to collinwood is nothing short of superb .
great fun throughout
( superbly
it is superbly filmed but when one discovers its real function
in directing which entails a communicative treat to film redeems the global weakness of the story and its doubtful aspect .
der todesking is not one of my favorite jorg buttgereit film -
or exploitation in the style of the nekromantik film or schramm will probably be disappointed .
but seriously - this is a sometimes beautiful
if you dig this type of film - check out subconscious cruelty - in my opinion the best art-house/horror film
7/10 for der todesking
he is superb .
he provides wonderful insight into the world of the trainable
the script itself holds the movie together wonderfully .
either we are collectively too stupid
stupidity abound .
you can have fun with this film .
moving and funny .
ben chaplin succeeds to avoid being completely out-shadowed by nicole ,
really bad this movie is .
this very tiresome and predictable movie .
i could go on and on about how bad this film is but i only have 1000 word .
which actually was the worst movie
than how terrible the soundtrack is.i hope
and musical ability.the acting is at best poor ,
the script is at best a crime against humanity ,
and denise richard is at best 67 % styrofoam and 33 % ziploc bag .
you know thing are bad
i have loved the character -
the not-so-stupid-as-you-think-he-is jack o'neill
sometimes even ridiculous ,
! funny-that sum this movie up in one word.what the crap was this `` thing '' ,
expecting to laugh at all the bad acting ,
and stupid corny dialogue ,
you will be highly disappointed .
( great expectation
while emily mortimer and rufus sewell played a cute couple in wes craven 's 'pre-lachaise'.natalie portman was beautiful as usual as the actress girlfriend of a visually impaired french boy in 'faubourg saint-denis ' .
execution by gena rowland in 'quartier latin ' was equally aww-inducing.this movie is perfect for those with adhd
she is a great actress.this movie
( anil kapoor )
his wife and kids.anil kapoor en juhi are natural born actor / actress .
they are great .
he is very annoying
not funny .
and is a waste of a cast of good actor
because you have got an excellent ensemble cast does
the basic premise of the film is not bad
it was less like a drama and more like a very bad episode of `` general hospital '' .
subtle
this is a rather awful film .
i had high hope as i usually love bad campy holiday horror movie ,
it is really just a bad attempt at showing a character slide slowly into insanity ,
is not a bad plot ,
but is done poorly here .
which are not intended to be funny ,
but not laugh-out-loud funny .
what a waste !
and was not disappointed .
it is funny ,
and the animation is excellent .
one bonus to the dvd is that it was fun to see both version of the pilot .
i am very disappointed
twin peak is one of the most boring title i
season 2 started with a 'funny ' scene
that is all.this scene is really boring and even long
their performance are wasted .
this is an excellent show !
this movie had some great actor in it !
the plot was great
to appear in this one.avoid this at all cost .
even doing the mst3k thing
tedious
dull
who lists night of the living dead at number three in her top five favorite movie of all time ,
not an insult .
it is intended to be funny ,
it is terrible .
that it is actually worse than a 1940s sci-fi movie .
ridiculously stupid
it was so bad
cracking good yarn with all the actor giving great value .
lot of nice twist and turn and probably the best of the philo vance series .
william powell looks wonderfully relaxed and at his debonair best .
there looked to be some promise of a mediocre affair ,
anne reid gives an excellent performance in spite of being given some peculiar situation and line ,
siegfried.her other is too weak to ing the murdered
and so is kriemhild.these movie deal with great theme
superbaby ... .oh dear ! !
and still enjoyable .
not seem to change a great deal ,
is a pretty bad movie
making it big ? this is a real lame movie
because the film maker fumbled the ball this time.do not waste your time with this movie .
( in fact the best acting was by the person
but the direction was horrible .
it was not bad enough to be a `` good-bad '' movie
it is more fun .
although he is my favorite .
and with thomas newman 's beautiful and haunting oscar nominated score to go along with it ,
but it was just boring .
unfortunately
a weak attempt
to waste the cast
-- -with the cast of saina the teenaged witch as the hero ... a movie so downright awful
pointless and with a `` monster '' so stupid and uncoordinated
the way a terrible
after a ridiculous ray-gun fight in a prison on another planet
it is that bad !
actually this movie was not so bad .
and also funny ,
`` the negotiator '' or `` the langolier '' he play a very sympathetic person ,
is not that bad ,
this could have had a 'bad news bear ' feel
and leaves a dull pain in your bone
is not fun to bag on
not fun to watch ,
boring .
as dull as the day is long
who do not have xp give this game a try.its a fun clean family game with action and its great for any spiderman fan.in the game
is a fun little game
and i recommend it to any spiderman fan or a parent wanting a fun
clean game for their kids.8/10
in your movie a stereotype is an extremely poor strategy -
but the script is so awful
it is hard to find anything redeeming .
a bit quirky and bordering bad taste ;
the acting was the best ,
and played it wonderful .
what made the original killer tomato fun was it was made by person with no budget
but it just was not as much fun .
but he is supported by lame actor
cheap special effect and unfunny gags.the plot .
they are going to stop him ... forgettable direct to video nonsense ...
i vote 7/10 .
and it is very fun to watch !
stone once again delivered a great character .
she looks amazing !
and a great ending
i particularly enjoyed the fight in tanger ,
`` the bourne ultimatum '' is definitely the best movie of the series and a very interesting and original action flick .
ian looked positively ridiculous .
with excellent special effect
it was a really great story for a made for television movie ... .and
unfortunately
all in all jeremy renner 's performance was not too bad .
avoid this one .
and that picture was pure silliness - and not very funny .
the story is extremely boring
is bad ,
what follows is a fascinating insight into a pathological personality ,
that is not astonishingly dramatic but unproven at best and most often
horrible .
horrible .
how it could get any worse .
joe raposo 's song are for the most part simply beautiful .
( sadly )
.very glossy movie in beautiful technicolor with jaw-dropping fashion and furnishing
everybody looks perfect and dress in beautiful
the story itself is lot of fun
but seeing them so young and glamorous is great ... especially stack ...
is fantastic
-- she deservedly won best supporting actress for her role .
vicious and sympathetic ... all convincingly .
fun
which could be made to this amazing achievement
the avoidable war
even after the fourth or fifth time its still unsettling.great film !
there is a lot of boring and totally irrelevant padding footage
which is not bad \u0096
but it is all so very pointless and ugly
and some truly embarrassingly lame pseudo-artistic camera trick
it is great .
super mario 64 is one of the greatest game in the history of 3d game .
10/10 .
a perfect 10 .
unfortunately ,
i particularly enjoyed the fact
stupidly contrived moment
of course some of the dialog was not perfect ,
that is exactly why i enjoyed the movie so much .
it is a perfect fit for this genre of a 70 's horror classic.the talent needs
adam jone has found an imaginative and refreshing way to empower his character and actualize what matters most .
but fortunately or unfortunately the film was a failure .
it was wonderful .
it is an episodic multi-character study of tokyo 's poorest ,
all the character were wonderful and all the story engrossing ,
an emotionally moving and beautiful film .
the film props itself as a fun and entertaining time .
the film is fun and entertaining.the camera work ,
being a tad weak ,
was overly enjoyable in the fact
but a fun watch and a fun experience .
( who 's very annoying ;
( very funny !
and moreover the weak obvious ending with- christmas is not all about present .
i felt stupid walking out of the theater with a bunch of baby and toddler laughing and so forth ,
frozen waste .
is superbly handled
this has to be one of the best of the whole series ,
this movie was not awful
she is a very beautiful and talented actress .
the book is great
the movie was a huge disappointment in my opinion i
i had enjoyed it a lot .
and bad.here is the plot .
that talking about how fat and bitchy our one classmate was to be far more enjoyable than paying attention to this movie .
best plan ever .
it is just a waste of 90 minute
getting there i found too predictable
and to this day i still consider it as the olsen twin ' worst .
while when in rome is not a terrible movie ,
it is not a great one either .
it is good fun for teenager ,
and i have enjoyed some of their movie like passport to paris and new york minute .
the soundtrack are not half bad either.however ,
sadly
it is harmless and predictable teenage fluff .
4/10 bethany cox
the accompanying music fits perfectly
i thoroughly enjoyed it in a way
it is superb and yet
but these actually make perfect sense in the long run
this undulating landscape of emotional cinematography creates a perfect balance
but this one must be among the very worst .
as this movie is soooo predictable .
as well as boring .
and annoying .
terrible.an example of how much this movie stinks .
not only is this scene pointless and not important
yuck.best scene of the movie is right at the end
shame on you ! 1/10 .
... ... this film is pretty awful ,
that `` awful '' look ,
it is also predictable but not in a good way .
it is also terrible )
that are subtle enough
what he ended up with was a confusing mess .
perhaps the most disappointing aspect to this film is that
*end spoilers*avoid this one .
for an excellent psychological
low budget porno flick would be an insult to the old
and it is family comedy entertainment at its best !
the hairdo on pitt - an exaggerated pompadour - was fun to look at .
this movie has some of the best martial art
she did a great job nontheless !
you are really missing out on some great martial art action .
stewart and sullavan are perfect as the average couple with real emotion and tension ,
and there are some funny moment
`` whipped '' is likely to be enjoyed only by the kind of young male
the self-conscious horror film reference are annoying
but it was refreshing to see such a nasty movie
that their best hope of getting back lies in provoking history
i am a fan of the previous best of the best film .
but this one was awful .
the acting was terrible ,
and the action was bad
as bad.i have never liked the original thunderbird ,
the best thing about the movie is when the credit roll up
i can not believe i wasted $ 7 watching this through pay-per-view .
that i enjoyed it .
the great plot comes from the novel by tim krabb\u00e9 ,
especially if you liked 'spoorloos '
this movie is beautifully designed !
is at his best in this role .
this may not be the best picture of the year ,
but it is a gem
the movie is played like a 50 's horror film only alot more fun
the videostore version is looking a little worse for the wear .
if any other fan of the movie want to e-mail me about it feel free.p.s another great performance from edie mcclurg
that he will be deserting his man at their greatest hour of need macarthur reluctantly ,
that gen. macarthur achieved his most illiant victory as well as his worst military defeat .
and disturbingly awful it is .
this is the worst .
i wasted over an hour of my life on this useless garbage ,
which showcases the great director in fledgling form.emily and fred hill
at least not here.the hill are a dull
subtlety was still to come.everything is shot in an aupt manner
nothing about the ending resonates.at least you get some enjoyable view of london in the early 1930s ,
great j.t .
in a perfect role for him )
the lighting by cinematographer marc reshovsky is superb in its moodiness ;
and walsh are all fun
who also graces the film with an enjoyable
and if nothing else is certainly never boring.8/10
in my life i have seen many great and awful movie .
these actor are the worst i
another awful thing is about these dialog -
they are so lame .
if my message reaches you - save your time and money .
we will walk in the ray of a beautiful sun .
yet there is an undiscovered gem
she is absolutely beautiful .
bing crosby is in great voice ,
but the song are not his best .
probably great in its time
avoid this waste of celluloid at all cost ,
the saddest part was that lame werewolf suit with the functional wang .
not to mention the acting is terrible
and the soundtrack is dubbed badly .
but do not waste your time or money
that i did not have the best time
heath ledger is great as always and the sexy naomi watts charms the screen.give this movie a chance
here a lot more emphasis is put on character and situation and messing with your mind .
dark and stylized template is complemented by great lurid lightning .
it shoves noir in our faces ,
and it is not necessary.what is worse is that the dialogue is a little contrived .
unfortunately
( an excellent book
i hate to spoil the fun of telling
beautiful
it made for a very enjoyable evening ,
nancy drew was never great literature .
nancy is perfect
it will never be a great movie ,
( portrayed by the amazing theater actor ian mcdiarmid )
was one the best part of the movie .
what an amazing end to such an iconic character .
the best part was of course the special effect .
it is amazing how a film from the early eighty can still stand the test of time
( leia look amazing in that metal bikini )
and incredible special effect is a fitting end to one of the most beloved franchise in cinema history .
a great premise is a great premise no matter
the performance are excellent throughout ,
wonderful choice of music
michael caine is superb as the sympathetic bartender .
jim belushi does a great job as an `` average joe '' kind of guy
always excellent
and even has some surprisingly moving moment in `` mr .
`` mr. destiny '' is not `` it is a wonderful life
`` mr. destiny '' is an enjoyable
funny
she painfully avoids any confrontation with human
these were a very dull and painful 90 minute .
normally i try to avoid wasting energy on bad film making .
how on earth did nanouk leopold get funding
the result is an insult rather than a tribute to a female perspective on life.to make thing worse ,
a perfect cure for insomnia .
is another gem in this fine director cap .
besides some superb action scene
superb production value
if it could get any worse .
this is lauren bacall 's least engaging role and one of her poorest performance .
and his is pathetic .
is the most sympathetic character .
he is best remembered as a nasty henchman in countless western ,
joe as a performer is far from the worst thing about this .
beyond a shadow of a doubt mysterious planet is one of the worst movie ever made ,
because the poverty of its special effect and astoundingly awful sound track in the first 15 minute
it is a lousy script with crappy character
i was bored stupid about 10 minute
but this is one of the worst movie i
so terrible
the effect are so poorly done you wonder
that the best they had was a guy
( migraine from the bad acting ?
there was great use of light and texture .
that loved this movie ... i wish i could find this on dvd somewhere ! !
i would love to watch this now just bc i loved
and found it very enjoyable .
filmed on location in north carolina and with a wonderful sound track of traditional music
and voyager started very bad
overall it was solid trek material
the opening theme is dull
what was really bad was the completely gratuitous lotion rubbing scene
this will be an interesting series.my favorite line :
image are great
quite boring ;
that grey owl was great environmentalist .
but this one was ... bad .
call it hard or soft or something stupid like that .
is not really that bad and at least the dialog is halfway intelligent
without the ridiculous awkward phrases
this is pretty standard stuff.3/10
with emotional subtlety
great acting
and some genuinely funny moment .
but it was incredibly dull and boring .
stupid humour
there just is not a cure for a poor script once in production .
in a word ... bad
at best .
the mib organization has a jrotc summer camp vibe.the movie was not terrible or anything..
and did not really add any originality to the mib universe.a perfect analogy would be episode 1 to the first 3 film .
as the worst movie ever made .
it is worse than a home video
it was just horrible .
to this day it is the worst movie i
who loved his earlier work like trust and amateur ,
what hartley does best is setting his story in small situation ,
be severely warned for a disappointment .
although this inn has a terrible past
to describe what is happening in this poorly scripted story ,
while the acting is simply sub-par with the bland character
child actor can be incredibly annoying ,
lochlyn munro and chandra west are somewhat solid ,
it was a okay time-waster
but at the same time extremely forgettable .
-- a fantastic work of art for the action genre .
that it is better than hofd.basic element from hero are found in hofd : great landscape
worse
but since the story is weak ,
to be avoided at all cost .
was a bit disappointing ,
ed wood look awfully good to me right now.when i return this piece of crap to the video store ,
you will be disappointed .
are terrible in this .
with a different outlook and more sympathetic compassion for grieving family .
this is one of my two or three favorite stooge short ,
and undoubtedly christine mcintyre 's best performance with the trio .
her singing is not funny at all ,
in fact it is downright beautiful ,
that strictly gives the phrase `` low budget '' a horrible name .
it is not an example of high camp fun ,
as big as a texas prairie and equally as boring .
taylor actually looks bad
making it an excellent choice for ridding yourself of unwelcome house guest .
this is not bela lagosi 's best movie ,
and the sexy robson greene lift this from the trash category to a very enjoyable `` romp '' .
who almost steals the show with a great `` laid back '' performance
he ever looked at her great body .
the whole thing is a great deal of fun ,
for letting the paying customer have their say in this fascinating venue .
if only it was because of the poor quality of film
watching the character of the domestic help conversing in perfect english is too unreal to be true .
* the quality of direction is very poor and some key and delicate scene have been poorly handled .
the other were wasted .
they get every willing televangelist to hype this film as the greatest thing since sliced white ead .
will they be disappointed and disillusioned ?
you will probably be disappointed .
best of all
i was disappointed
was responsible for this fascinating look at life in the arctic among the inuit .
( although some annoying rear projection effect show
which is a major elemant in the narrative.this pre-code film deal in a refreshingly frank manner with the eskimo moral code
and is absolutely splendid and perfectly believable in what was a very demanding part .
all too ief flashback to the original band on stage ing us some wonderful music ,
and judi dench turn in superb leading performance as the recently widowed elizabeth
the late joan sim is perfect as the band 's leader ,
cameo appearance by other great like cleo laine
is still an incredible fox
that charlie would end up redeeming himself like john wayne in the searcher or jame stewart in the naked spur .
is unforgettable .
unfortunately
this movie was a huge disappointment.like other have commented
akshay kumar 's performance is average at best and john aaham should not try doing comedy again .
was fun
and some of the song are fun .
as they started to boringly repeat the same pattern.that very thing ,
may be one of the best feature of mazinger z. another good point is its inventiveness
unfortunately
one way this movie fails is that just about every piece of each set
looked cheesy and cheap .
the other major reason this movie is horrible is the acting
as to how horrible it would actually end up being.thankfully ,
eddie was young and funny with his 80 's haircut .
and she was not bad .
altogether a rather enjoyable movie
the cinematography was excellent regarding many of these scene .
the rationale for the negative energy was ludicrous at best ,
what could have been a superb horror film
was ultimately haunted by a terrible ending .
and that is why i was slightly disappointed .
i was not the best movie from korea
the acting of jeon do-yeon is incredibly beautiful .
it was was one of the best performance in the early cinema history
what a major disappointment.the cast is superb
one example is the portrayal of frank hirsch 's unfaithfuness :
followed by her predictable pleading of a headache ,
is great ,
this film has some great gore ,
this is a particularly well acted and beautifully shot film .
horrible acting
horrible cast and cheap prop .
what a waste .
the blond girl just having the same blank boring look on her face at all time .
like the cheap line given before a sex scene in a porn movie .
horrible .
do not waste your time .
the song are beautiful ,
the costume are beautiful ,
the voice are beautiful ,
i have seen worser movie than this one ,
1/10 .
worst acting ever .
no really worst acting ever .
is the worst of the bunch
but he is amazingly god-awful . )
that the film actually has any redeeming quality for mr. hess to ruin .
funniest
all wreaked of perfection .
this is the kind of perfectionism
i know it sounds boring ,
she fits perfectly .
( played to perfection by kaley cuoco ) :
perfection .
was the second funniest character imo before the passing of ritter
carefully and excellently
a surprisingly welcome addition to the series
( played to insanely funny height by david spade ) :
i knew spade was funny ,
he was this funny .
talk show and function
and delivering a superb impersonation of spade 's voice and comedy style
spade was crazy-funny ;
so funny.the show 's humor and drama were both upped
sadly .
and i saved the best for last :
this movie was absolutely awful .
the casting for the movie was terrible .
the acting was so terrible
and hoping for the god-awful thing to end.secondly ,
i had seen some bad movie ,
bad acting
some fascinating shot of japane life
the film starts with a muddled meeting of radically stupid radical student ,
looking for freedom or something like that.antonioni 's predictable assault on capitalism is not only intellectually hollow ,
by far the greatest irony about the hippie - and antonioni
only in a successfully-functioning capitalist system can you find
while including overlong scene of pointlessness
with a high dullness factor .
his attempt at symbolism are annoying and trite .
at best .
and disliked this awful review ,
where you can make the final your own choice.great family film !
no wonder scott avoids her
it must be terrible to be an ordinary woman in a culture as cruel as our .
she is beautiful
and they are both handled with perfect seriousness
this movie started badly
it consists of extremely poor acting and unrealistic effect
than this lot.some of it was actually laughable
what a bad movie .
and that the game is even being played in a torrential downpour ... .one of the worst ever scene in a sport movie .
great plot twist as well as exciting action .
is that it is dull .
while it is also far from subtle ,
it is fun throughout ,
while the mad magician is a wonderful film ,
and both are great fun to watch .
she just made a bad choice here .
this film is the best film jim carrey has ever made .
i rate this film a 9/10 .
jimmy stewart and anthony mann teamed to do some of the best western ever
and this is one of the best.the real star of the film however is the spectacular canadian rocky
some of the best cinematography ever done in the history of film.in all five of the western
the supporting role were perfectly cast .
one of the best western ever .
i consider both gillian anderson and danny dyer to be good at what they do and was interested to see what dan reed could come up with but unfortunately it just did not work for me.the problem lies in the fact that the film does not really seem to understand
and as such it fails to impress on drama
( bad mistake )
is the horrible
horrible dialogue .
and this is the worst of them all .
i enjoyed longstreet ,
obvious/ stupid way out of it .
batman 's not a great detective .
but the most insulting has got to be mr freeze.do
for example the mind numbingly weak acting
( when it is this bad
the most annoying was the total lack of common sense in the script ,
executed exponentially dreadfully .
who is pretty much one of the most downright strikingly beautiful girl in any cheesy sci-fi film ,
( actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole picture ) ,
the special effect are not the greatest ,
than it should in such a `` bad '' movie .
is when the beautiful girl causes yeti 's nipple to become erect
but even this is not that bad ,
it does not get boring -
sadly
are a poor afro-american family
( awful )
a slightly funny line and the audience would go mad and start clapping .
apart from that it was a very funny show .
this show is pretty bad .
she had the most annoying voice i have ever heard on television ,
and many of the other girl seemed to be obsessed with the idea of meeting `` the perfect man ' .
many great guy out there
that would make great husband ,
it really is a terrible show
the best dating show by a country mile are blind date and the fifth wheel
because they are fun .
sadly takes itself way too seriously .
the two of them will get into all kind of funny situation
than he gave her credit for.the result is a perfect summer film with a lot of laugh
that is just what one needs to get out of the heat into a perfect time in a cool theater .
this funny man will never get rid of ,
the film has some funny one liners
the beautiful star of `` scoop '' ,
seems to be the perfect foil for woody allen .
a perfect combination .
both are excellent in their banter throughout the film .
it becomes most annoying .
that is what we have here - a most annoying movie
( offbeat and annoying )
is a mess i now remember
are superb .
and loses badly .
bad language
the iowa and wisconsin landscape are beautifully shot ,
-- it is fun all the way through .
when a friend gave me a boxed set of `` 12 amazing scifi/horror movie ! ''
because it looked the best of the bunch .
if this is the best of them ,
an jeff ... .well ... he is done the good and the bad as far as film and tv go . ''
pretty lame prison ,
are truly horrible .
alien boring
max tries his best ,
the rest of the film is bland and uninspired.made in 1992 ,
it seems.it is best avoided .
i was really disappointed by it .
which is remarkably forgettable .
the character are dull
this movie is terrible .
where he has purposely avoided a `` hollywood clich\u00e9 '' .
it is fine to avoid them ,
someone with less disdain for the `` hollywood convention '' of traditional storytelling could create a wonderful film with this idea .
i have seen many bad film over the year ,
and this beats the lot ! this is not just a `` so bad
it is good '' exploiter waste of time
it was really this awful .
worse even than lee major in the norseman
which can be quite fun watching with popcorn and friend
of course it is fun
was not horrible ,
nor was it great ,
but it was enjoyable to watch.i felt
as if jim carrey got a little annoying at times.they made the grinch seem like a special education person ,
was beautiful ,
it was just annoying.this movie could have been `` so '' much better
because most of the humor was not funny.i liked how the grinch stole christmas anyway ,
when movie are that stupid ,
best horror film ever .
the costume and effect are great in this movie ...
i loved them the first time i saw them on star trek :
sean young does another great turn as an unemotive replican not ,
here.unfortunately the movie took itself
i am just not going to get that sympathetic.freddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the movie with the hallucination and what not ,
but unfortunately they were few and far between and by the end of the movie ,
it had degenerated into a bad episode of celeity deathmatch ...
only not funny .
one of the worst movie i have ever seen .
there is nothing good going on here with all the beat as predictable as night following day .
yet l'emploi du temps also possessed an elegant look thank to excellent camera work and some stunning location footage
that is a major pathway to the xerox machine and restrooms.obnoxious coworker use the front of carla 's desk to chat
both of my child really enjoyed this movie .
that is so bad
disappointing :
but i will stop here.10/10
and why southerner are still fighting that civil war today.too bad we can not use
what a horrible legacy slavery gave us.acting pretty good
for how stupid the war was
so much suffering for such a stupid cause.the cinematography is fantastic .
one of my favorite part of any movie .
than that to import what is one of the worst-quality dvds i
the film has no redeeming quality
in spite of an equally lousy script
so one could be forgiven for thinking this is a case of bad direction.as i have indicated already ,
nobody wants to be the other man in this kind of messed-up situation ,
while liev is a great actor ,
anna paquin earns it a bonus point with one of her best performance
and it is still fresh and funny .
the film has some gem lines/scene ... ..reference
where the star are now ... ..joey ramone sadly died young .
... .just have fun !
it is still one of my all-time favorite .
great storyline
incredible cast of character
and a truly wondrous rhythm and blue score by the great curtis mayfield.the story ,
but luckily the uniformly excellent work evident in the film 's other department almost completely cancels out schumacher 's flat
-- and great singer to boot .
almost unbelievably fantastic song
clearly copping top musical honor as the best-ever song in the entire movie .
by far the worst movie of all time .
this movie was one of the best disney movie
great for the entire family to watch .
and the acting is great .
highly recommended .
i have seen bad acting before ,
many time ... . funny
funny stuff .
we had wonderful movie such as this one.being a big fan of both wodehouse and fred astaire i was delighted to finally see this movie .
including the wonderful fairground with revolving floor and funhouse mirror ,
the superb acting between mastroianni and loren .
my vote is 10/10 .
with bad acting and low budget production.the movie should be 1/3 the time ,
are so stupid and illogical
the solder log stupid
but just totally stupid .
there is absolutely no reason to waste time on this ,
simply a must see*** = a solid
but was happily surprised and disappointed .
disturbing alcoholic with a messed mind .
mixed oil and water.i also very much enjoyed juliette lewis 's performance .
it is so rare for this talented young actress
it is like those tv movie with bad cast and plot .
it is amazing how they could make this sequel worse than the iii .
do not waste your time watching this crap ,
but the acting is amazing
if your looking for some light and funny entertainment ... my favorite episode is `` pancake madness '' ... a hilarious episode .
the best season is probably 3 ... i am not really a fan of some of the seventh season twist ...
and very poorly acted ... plus
and i was really sad to see one of my favorite show canceled !
the previous year 's across the universe decidedly weak
is a solid success .
it has a great story
excellent performance
just when everything is going pear-shaped at the festival reunion performance ... hugely enjoyable .
and the poor actor !
given this terrible dialog ,
none of them came across looking anything but ridiculous .
for him to appear in a vehicle this poor
bad
bad movie .
they are two of my favorite character in this film
the stepmother is not as annoying as her ugly and selfish daughter .
her beautiful pink dress is much nicer than the one
expression make him funny .
there is nothing annoying about him.the soundtrack is simple but pleasant
although not among disney 's best .
the best song in this movie is `` bibiddi bobiddi boo '' .there are plenty of well
the movie is just as fun
which in reality seemed like fruit punch.most of all the plotting seemed very horrid to even call this piece of crap a movie.the rest of the character in this movie are total waste of time ,
the ending was awful ,
and the scene were terrible .
and a talentless director.this movie is such a waste of your time .
you will be so disappointed .
the movie 's actor were just bad .
the best actor in there was the old man
who loved her dearly ,
an enjoyable disney classic .
to show her amusemant at their jealousy ,
and it is as bad in its reasoning as any attempt
to justify organized religion with similar pseudo-scientific arguments.avoid this film.oh yeah .
it is wonderful and enough of a reason
is awful .
but in this case it becomes tedious .
instead we get some smart dialog and great performance in a film
that does not let them be real.despite some great performance and witty dialog this is only a 4/10
this show was a perfect description of african-american life .
sally field is absolutely perfect as celest talbert
still has that wonderful and beautiful pixie quality and a perfect figure
kathy najimy is wonderful as the hapless costume designer
and best of all
should have won oscar for best comedy
best leading man in a comedy and myriad other best ,
action sequence are from the seventies.cheoreography of the film is awful .
no budget film can be surprisingly good ...
the scenery is bland and boring
and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn
and they are just as bad .
the worst ever military push-up in a film .
imagine the worst skit from saturday night live and mad tv in one 90 minute movie .
now imagine something 50 time worse.got that ? ok
that vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever .
ucm is the single worst movie
there were a few cheap laugh ... very few .
but it was lame .
even if the intent of the movie was to be lame ,
it was too lame to be funny.the only reason
this is by far one of my favorite of the american pie spin off
it consistently ranks as one of the worst film of all time .
the acting is horrible ,
the script lacks direction and the director himself does not seem sure on which way
that they wasted their time and gift
making this mess of a movie .
is just insulting.after watching the show ,
but it was great once i found out .
all the performance where great to me
but my favorite were purple rain
great movie and now i can not even find one of those tee shirt :
at its best
and this is one 's a hidden gem.it is hard to gauge today
like these on screen.the actor are superb \u0096 the best brit have to offer .
the love story is beautifully handled
defined and beautiful a face could survive that petrifying hairstyle .
no one 's perfect ) .
highly recommended :
the writing was just terrible .
but amy did a great job .
pathetic attempt to use science
about quantum physic in this mess is just plain wrong.example ?
solid particle can pass through barrier .
but much more annoying is the narrative
an amazing series
but the director cut out her best scene .
( i blame the director )
just plain stupid movie i have seen in a long time.as for the direction ,
before it was completed.it is a bad rip off of `` m '' the classic fritz lang film
moore seems to haggardly move through this mess definitely not one of his better effort .
the rest were just terrible .
and horrible costume there were .
it began with some poor peasant
the lead soldier 's `` armour '' being about 5 size too big for the poor fellow .
perfectly aimed shot all around one soldier 's hand
and stop to help an amazingly well dressed and clean `` peasant '' with digging a ditch ...
this was so bad ,
even that terrible kevin costner version of robin hood was better.i highly suggest you skip this monstrosity ,
i loved it the third time .
now it is one of my all time favorites.the humor
cher 's search for love is enjoyable to watch .
the best job nicholas cage has done on film .
the old man character is fantastic .
perhaps the best character is the one
welcome to the lunacy of cheaply made direct to video movie .
all added a great degree of believability .
however this gem was not one of them .
the movie was in my opinion poorly written and directed .
i can justify passing judgement to any character
when just a word or so could eak the ice and promote healing.a horrible tragedy strikes a montana family .
while certain other point finger of blame
( and then go ahead and cheat on their poor pregnant wife
it is truly a blessing for the poor kid
for something he should not blame himself for .
which apparently was a lousy one anyway
whom i have not seen anywhere else except for a childhood favorite
did an incredible job as arnold
a great performance from a child actor.aside from being somewhat slow at time ,
the stone boy is an excellent
`` down to earth '' fails miserably ;
this is one incredibly bad production.chris rock is a lousy standup comedian
but they are in a pointless and unconvincing love story filled with contrivance and recycled material .
in the funny scene the character are exposed to awkward experience ,
that are tedious and painful ;
there are so many unfunny joke and horrible comic situation .
mark addy does not do any worse here
very bad .
not in the usual uwe boll `` so bad it is actually entertaining '' way ,
but just plain bad .
who leads a terrible life
and with an awful 900 pound cheating wife .
and what follows is just under two hour of completely incomprehensible sex and violence.the acting is awful
the acting is superb along with the fine audio soundtrack
it is my all time favorite movie ahead of eastwood `` white hunter
this movie is simply the best.cheer zuf
patrick swayze is an excellent alan quatermain ,
i enjoyed it .
i was still bitterly disappointed !
it was that bad ! ! !
and the acting was terrible
it is a total waste of money
being disappointed afterward .
the acting is superb .
that the actor enjoyed making this film .
and this film has made me an even greater fan of king .
but the second time is the worst ,
it is almost perfect .
pet sematary deliver great scare
this is truly one of most favorite horror film of all time .
10/10 .
this disappointing waste of film is an open faced insult .
show of fun
that those of us in the heartland are stupid
was severely disappointed with the movie
because it did not capture what i loved about the book -
the absolutely ridiculously funny erica and the interesting way
it was not all that bad
that i could not help but feel disappointed =p
this film is the great mystery of a murder in a locked room .
all badly represented ,
and the set is cheap ,
worse
even makes the movie more ridiculous .
chance are you are going to be positively surprised by a diversity of element superbly explored in this criminal thriller .
this story is a complex and wonderful tale of the last harem of the ottoman empire ,
enjoyed the story
otherwise a wonderful piece.the main character safiya is played wonderfully by marie gillain
who i am pleased to say did a fantastic job
because 99/100 time
and not just because it is cheap.the acting is mediocre ,
but i do not blame the actor ;
characterization is thin at best
no thank to weak dialogue and soporific direction .
that the script and the direction are pretty lame ?
no great character moment
that defies rational analysis and awkwardly shamble to its ridiculous finish .
it dwells on absurdity and poorly staged event
if only for their time wasted on career blind alley like this one ;
they are all eminently forgettable
this would be a long and boring talking-head flick full of static interior takes
`` election '' is a highly fascinating and thoroughly captivating thriller-drama ,
nice one.the worst thing was
as stripping at a funeral.i really wish
it was terrible and stupidly predictable .
mainstream cinema seems to be going downhill and film like this worsen the situation .
if you get the urge to see this absolutely awful film ,
that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot\u0097 too much fun ,
that is no fun to watch.ritter don glass
everybody looks great
his rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of hollywood story ,
only a waste of rental .
director ray taylor does his best with limited resource and extensive stock footage .
awful .
( it is amazing
it is undeniably good to see david alan grier in a rare straight role as activist fred hampton
after the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie `` gwoemul ''
have become more and more fantastic .
by making a whole series of big budget mediocre movie like mainland china did ?
the movie might have had a few more redeeming quality other
this is one of the greatest love story movie i have ever seen .
charlie chaplin was horribly boring .
he was fantastic .
it is entertaining and enjoyable
is a classic and something rarely if ever matched in cinema .
spit-swapping and worse ,
black mask is not terrible ,
but it certainly is not great either .
are all perfect.best of all
but it sure is fun.the crypt keeper
this movie was recommended to me
this was one of the worst i have seen .
but ciaran hind plays the perfect mr. rochester in the 1997 a/e version
and provided some of the best drive-in memory to ever come outside of the drive-in.without a doubt ,
the best late night television ever .
disappointed by this movie .
and if it was not bad enough ,
they had to sink it even further with that awful reggae music .
as personally annoying i find charle boyer 's voice ,
this was one of the worst movie i
the plot is awful ,
and the acting is worse .
do not bother to waste your time on a dumb movie such as this .
maze and monster felt like i wasted 101 minute of my life .
the only redeeming quality of the movie were scene
but just ended up being funny
since they were so bad .
you want to avoid wasting your time and money
this movie is perfect for all the romantic in the world .
and has the best line in the movie !
is lovely to look at and so much fun to play along with .
ben gazzara was an excellent cast and easy to fall in love with .
an excellent choice to pick up any evening . !
you rarely saw after that generation .
and million of person enjoyed it .
feroze khan and all film actors/actress for this wonderful movie about great person and relationship with his son .
amanda byne is such an excellent actress
she is a very funny person
so great.i especially loved the show
nick zano is very hot and funny
the whole cast was great ,
i especially loved 'lauren ' ;
she is the best !
she helped make the show extra funny
it has the worst acting i have ever seen .
and stupidity is taken to a new level .
and the bad cgi .
this deserves the title of 'being so bad
star trek is the greatest television phenomenon
my other favorite is when the 2nd officer on the klingon ship challenges riker 's authority as first officer and riker beat the living crap out of that klingon .
great thing have happened already in a mere 2 season with 5 more to go and a handful of movie !
as an adult i see now what great actor the star trek universe provides .
what seemed rather boring suddenly turns very exciting with a surprising twist in the story .
but it is a illiant example of great war-time propaganda .
( ignore all his later best picture academy award ;
this movie lacks the comedy of most of pickford 's other film ,
or watching america 's favorite canadian import sinking in it ?
all throughout the film demille runs his protagonist from one kind of horrible calamity to another ,
somewhere between the advent of sound and `` the greatest show on earth ''
which was beautifully directed
the script is not bad ,
as boring as she usually is )
as you toss this into the waste disposal unit .
disjointed - poorly filmed - non directed junk .
and badly attempt
to join the part into a pathetically weak story .
is a waste ,
it is funny .
it ranges from great to crap
sometimes quite boring
could not his message about acceptance of a person 's gender-confusion be handled better
-- the bad seems to be out-weighing the good .
every frame is filled with fantastically bold composition .
the final court scene is also fantastic ,
and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful ,
he lights kim hunter 's face makes her all the more beautiful
i give this film a 10/10
this is all the more amazing
it probably would have been solid .
the best documantary i have ever seen .
9.5/10 .
this film is builds up solidly
that is superbly unpredictable
this show was absolutely great ,
and it was completely entertaining and different from a lot of other show.everybody was just absolutely insane and eathtakingly funny ,
to where it just really did not matter.this was one of the best show to ever be aired ,
never gets unfunny ,
it is the unity of two hero from two great seventy sci-fi film .
one is great ,
and one is quite bad .
the great one is truly great ,
in fact it is the best .
the bad one is truly bad ,
in fact it is the worst .
of course of the great i refer to `` star war ''
the worst sci-fi film ever made .
that no one cares about this meeting of two great sci-fi hero ,
that this is one of the best/worst movie of all time .
just might be the most annoying character of all time ,
but it is a fun movie
is not that great ,
and enjoy this muddled gem
the cast did a great job
funnier ,
that does not feel like a cheap gimmick ,
the film of upa are surprisingly well rated on imdb
the film were dirt cheap
lousy animation was becoming the norm
it is probably not a great film for the kid .
and you can not seriously consider them great work of art
this was downright good.my kid loved this ,
it was laugh out loud funny at some part
the reference were actually rather subtle ) ,
but plenty of fun for the kid .
this is a great movie for kid of any age
jeffrey hornaday 's choreography for the film is dull and unimaginative
is given one of the show 's best number
it is a very beautiful sweet movie ,
acting is great ,
this is an awful movie .
awful enough ,
how bad it is .
what follows in the ridiculous plot just fills me with disbelief .
combined with the poor acting ,
not because it is a superbly consistent movie ,
as it goes against the portray-white-on-black-violence-and-win-an-oscar trend.also the acting performance are superb - especially oprah
the only thing worse is the film itself .
unbelievably terrible script .
direction is staggeringly bad .
no wonder lifetime has such a bad reputation .
if you fast forward through the horrible singing ,
christopher walken is very humorous and surprisingly good in the role .
this is one of the worst film ever .
i like cheesy movie but this is simply awful .
i have no one to blame except myself .
it will be much more enjoyable .
the dubbing was as bad
jet li is definitely a great martial artist ,
this is the best example .
this plot is ridiculous ,
that it is ridiculously funny ?
so either the film was savagely cut or the screenplay was a mess from the start .
are so under-used and wasted
that it is laughable .
this will be best known for the ferrari
and betting is a poorly made by the number
but its not bad enough
too afraid to rent a porno or the sport illustrated swimsuit dvd.avoid this movie at all cost
is as poor a representation of history as early us westerns
a message about how success and fame change a person
that is what mr. water is trying to achieve.it is fascinating
that agent must have referenced star war a lot.this movie was so bad i figured
yet this one sticks out in my mind as the worst of my childhood
only acknowledge eddie and sister act 2 as your worst you lucky stiff .
predictable
and absolutely loved it !
she plays the role pitch-perfect.this is a movie about friendhip -
unfortunately
and this movie probably could have benefited from overall tighter editing.but this was a refreshingly fun film
funny
charming and fun
that could ... and did.excellent .
8/10 .
this movie is my favorite as well as my wife 's .
all actor turn in a great performance ,
the first joke was just so appallingly lame and dreadfully acted
boring
who obviously did their best with the material available .
why.the movie was by far one of the worst i
was god-awful !
we talked about how bad it was ,
it was like we expected to see rita and lord zed portraying commander of sauron 's army.the creature were ridiculous .
not in an hour and a half.the scene transition are horrible .
because of the badly written dialog in the script.the final scene
that the other hero had.do not waste your time or money on this movie .
this film is not terrible .
it is not poor .
which is part of roger ebert 's `` great movie '' collection .
why is this movie so bad ?
it was lame
and it could have been funny
its main drawback is that it is just not very funny .
do not waste your time here .
one of the best part of sundance is seeing movie
rehearsed and ultimately performed.the movie is filled with fascinating revelation for those of us
the best
the editing was horrible .
some are really bad
but are quite enjoyable
which actually are really great for what they are ,
maybe those movie are not perfect ,
who is just hysterical funny
which i thought is a great mix of sick humor and a beautiful romance
which was great entertainment with some really memorable line
and not badly acted at all from the former `` bennifer '' -couple ,
when i heard the rumor of a sequel to one of my favorite movie i
why it gets such a bad press and such a bad voting here .
but it is more than her being beautiful ,
and all of the other actor deliver solid performance
this film has great acting
great photography and a very strong story line
there already are excellent comment dealing with these aspect .
in approaching the purity and force of the great greek tragedy both in story line and formal setting .
one of b- and c-movie producer roger corman 's greatest cult classic was the ramone vehicle
( originally designated for cheap trick ) ,
that made napoleon dynamite character funny
( played by cult classic favorite
it culminates into an ultimate revolt between the obsolete fun-hating adult and the teenager
it was great to see a movie
that celeated the fun of it all and in such a humorous ,
but a great feel-good comedy nonetheless
the original is still the best .
the performance are executed with certain aplomb and a refreshing command over its varied character
which was a hilarious and poignant comedy \u0096 the best thing
is utterly pointless and flat .
i would put this man can not die on the dull side of the genre .
it is not that the movie is particularly bad ,
but it lacks the illiance and flash of some of the other sws i have seen .
but lacks the on-screen charisma necessary
she is the one ight spot in this otherwise mediocre film .
unfortunately
what a terrible situation for the guy
i found it an enjoyable movie .
( `` the perfect bait '' )
it has a great looking monster ,
stupid one liner and move in a manner more
to avoid .
you are paying too much.avoid .
this film is my favorite of vincent price 's work .
watching a beloved other
what a great british movie
a great man
as all great brit movie should !
if you have beloved actor
massive talent is totally wasted in `` three day to vegas '' ,
there really are no redeeming factor here ,
and watching these wonderful actor struggling with such weak material is a crime .
this film actually was surprisingly good !
and enjoying the refreshing acting .
this may be the worst film i have ever seen .
to the unbelievably bad dialog
it was all just beyond awful .
dunaway is one of the best actor ever .
shecky moskowitz is unfunny ,
it is the worst movie i
and she was just her usual annoying
aged convincingly due to the poor make-up .
hudson looked ridiculous
that is the great yokai war.the setup
and often funny journey through the world of japanese folklore ,
not to traumatize any child to bad .
did much worse ,
with enough visual drama and great performance
another beautiful
funny
an intriguingly bold film weaves the seemingly effortless camerawork with some superb casting and an explosive soundtrack
the film explodes into neo-noir exploration of everything the outside world does not usually expect to see in this country
becomes increasingly strained by jealousy over the beautiful gracia .
but otherwise this movie was rather weak .
this movie was a mess .
unfortunately
`` this movie is boring . ''
and the lighting is excellent .
isabelle huppert 's creditable performance also helps save it from being a waste of time .
4/10 .
it\u00b4s one of the best horrormovie ever .
his shizophrenic behaviour is hard to understand and it\u00b4s horrible to see his two side or identity fighting against each other .
but this terrible cry - does
who did a fantastic job
eddie murphy delirious is by far the funniest thing
that delirious is the funniest movie ever !
eddie murphy has given so many funny performance over his career
and it is funnier every time .
every great stand up performance will be emulated from delirious .
is an enjoyable little film
is in poor taste ,
short subject were the perfect complement to the studio ' feature film .
boom mic operation and other technical aspect of this film are laughable
unfortunately its not the only areas.unlike some classic independent film
that have been saved by their script great characterization and plot ,
this unfortunately has an awful script ,
awful acting and worst of all ,
awful annoying characters.it is a crime
has already authored a best picture candidate .
the soloist is a weak drama with no external conflict
this material would have been better suited as a made-for-tv production rather than a feature film.wright includes many scene of cheap humor
worst of all
but the soloist is much weaker than either of them .
i would not be so disappointed with it
and he feels a great affection for her .
the story is excellent ,
the cast is composed by excellent actor and actress ,
the cinematography has wonderful moment ,
i personally loved
is one of the best
( `` flame of the revenge '' )
this was one of the worst movie i
that uses every stupid
how stupid it is .
this along with `` haunted '' are probably two of the best ghost story i have ever scene .
was the funniest character
and being able to appreciate some of the subtler `` symbolic '' aspect of the cinematography ,
hayworth did an excellent job .
the first 50 minute or so are extremely bland and soap-operatic ,
the funhouse climax uses cinematography
the beautifully framed and silhouetted shot of the san francisco aquarium
the lady from shanghai is not exactly a terrible film
funny film
and has some funny joke .
from the tedious emotional film of the 70 's and 80 's
depressing and boring.during the 90 's and 00 's several really great movie were made by a 'new generation ' of filmmaker .
it is just simply not funny .
especially with a cast like this with a few really funny comedian .
is it the overacting totally ridiculously unrealistic football coach ?
the movie is just not funny !
she does a superb job
all to great effect .
that aspire to make some great point
was pathetic .
almost ingest one from a restaurant eadbasket crossed the line of stupidity .
the patterned and predictable plot twist are easily figured out long
was laughable .
that this film gives is refreshing to avid movie fan ,
only because loud noise tend to do that to the dozing viewer.while the acting was lame ,
perhaps the only redeeming quality
as this film may very well be the worst in his entire catalog of screen performance .
the first howling by joe dante was a groundeaking werewolf film with its incredible special effect and its campy sense of style and subject matter .
inane dialog and does ridiculous thing
and his band babel play through much of the film in the beginning and the ending with that dreadful noise .
while it contains poor shot
bad dialogue
it strives to be the dumbest
that it was going to be horrible .
the whole thing is stupid !
the worst thing i have ever seen .
it was not funny ,
it was not even so bad
it is just bad .
please do not waste your money on this movie .
the second one was significan notly weaker ...
while in disguise that person blame him for jaffar 's deed and hate him .
abu has to climb a great web
to get to the gem
this fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer alexander korda .
oliver messel and marcel verte .
as the princess mary morris is a sad and beautiful halima ,
it best i can because to my knowledge ,
though it is a great technique.think of `` yellow '' as a living thing ,
this movie is the worst i have seen in the last 5 year .
when a jeep full of bad guy comes .
and one of bad guy is her neighbor
that watching stupid scenario film ...
i give a rating of 2/10.guys ,
you can watch this to have some laugh at the terrible fight scenes.that all .
at best .
but not too bad .
and somewhat predictable.the white star line bit is cute ,
i have rated this movie 3/10
this is one of the worst one
by watching this film you could be educated about how it felt for us victim this film teaches us not to take life for granted or to mess with corn ,
its amazing and educational
it is he best example of film noire since chinatown.it will
unfortunately
it was not as bad
and how they affect event in the original lion king.there are actually some very funny joke in the movie .
my favorite part is when they show the pair raising simba .
for me the worst part have to be
.the voice talent are excellent .
nathan lane and ernie sabella do a wonderful job ,
i enjoyed the ``
this movie ... it was horrible .
are bad
who played 'scarecrow ' was amazing ,
but it just came out awful .
we are awful ,
if you can avoid watching this movie in anyway ,
his character is not well scripted.beverly johnson is as beautiful a woman
the film might have gained a great deal
the music is poor
and omar sharif makes one of his many pointless cameos
.richard fleischer has to be blamed
he was an infuriatingly unpredictable film director ,
and this is one of his weaker movie .
there is absolutely no reason to waste your time with this `` film '' .
unforgettable performance by scott wilson and robert blake .
in giving viewer a fun ride .
and it was fun to see viewer go wild over this one .
and without doubt the best in the halloween franchise .
carpenter shows great restraint
halloween marked the film debut of jamie lee curtis and a defining point in the late great donald pleasance 's career .
`` no refunds ! ''
but it is my biggest movie disappointment of the year .
`` europa '' is an impressive and anguishing kafkanian story of the great danish director lar von trier .
this movie discloses a difficult period of germany and some of the problem this great nation had to face
we should not mess with batman ,
but we could mess with the villain . ''
it squeezes by my rating with a 2/10 simply
whom we see at the end.the second major disappointment of the film is that
this is going to be a great movie .
this film is a trifle at best .
it was just another boring
quite beautiful .
and sadly
that janeane is best known for ,
and destroying a local laboratory.this episode is incredible .
the mayor is perfect due to the embodiment al pacino offers us
is not original or funny .
and the joke are used and predictable
is just plain boring .
funny ,
and it is best.i had my doubt ,
sometimes he gets involved in bad project ;
what an extraordinary beautiful woman
`` my super ex-girlfriend '' is delightfully silly and funny .
luke wilson is great in the role of an idiot ,
and uma thurman is great in the role of a deranged neurotic superhero
all the actor in this film give really great performance .
it from you favorite movie rental place .
for making them sit through this pointless crap .
it was my absolute favorite costume.honestly ,
disney can make a wonderful villain .
in a wonderfully calculating
probably my favorite of any disney heroine .
bibbidi bobbidi boo ... cinderella is a wonderful heartfelt story with a ton of musical highlight .
it does provide some classic villain and excellent voice work .
so he tries to kill himself but every attempt fails .
jack lemmon 's play is wonderful .
he is the perfect clown .
look for the wonderful scene
10/10 !
a good cast and they do their best with what they are given ,
as being 'the best
laputa is the greatest animated film ever made .
and it best captures his strength as a director
as well as encapsulating all of his favorite underlying theme .
and that version is the single best dub i have ever encountered of any film .
with telegraphs and ancient motorcar alongside those wonderful impossible flying machine .
being a thoughtfully designed and beautifully rendered film ,
laputa is blessed with a wonderful sense of cinematography .
the film also contains one of my favorite
that laputa has an amazing score .
the score match the visual perfectly ,
a rare total union of sound and vision.this is not a bad dub .
and van der beek is wonderful .
you are sacrificing a great deal
when the best scene in this movie featured scott baio
but that is no excuse for this boring mess .
but worst of all
do not waste your time
unfortunately
but the film still drags badly .
and the setting and general color scheme is drab and boring .
the film is not completely terrible
but the full length film is dull .
only recommended to very patient and determined kitumura fan .
just boring after an hour or so .
and everything is beautifully drawn .
predictable plot with cliched
predictable character
predictable ending .
we are treated to numerous pointless cameo appearance by popular character with little or no relevance to the plot whatsoever
this mess of a movie reaches its climax with the unintentionally farcical final battle ,
if you are a fan of movie so bad
you will not be disappointed with batman mystery of the batwoman .
fan of `` the passion of the christ '' will no doubt be disappointed by the lack of gory spectacle and arch characterization .
but are corny and unenjoyable ;
every joke is predictable and expected ,
but instead are dull and dragging too many time .
that is this bad ,
that i felt a bit disappointed .
because of bad script .
just like for admirer of beautiful diane lane .
legendary tommy lee jone is always great
so if you get hooked up by this great cast watch it
rest of it is very forgettable .
and if you are looking for a cheap horror movie to laugh at :
usually i will go for stupid
if it is funny ,
but this stupid was so stupid it almost
make me stupid.the film quality is better than a handheld ,
but add this amazing
the acting bad and the motivation clueless .
if i owned a video store i would put it in the boring section .
the best greek comedy series ever !
brilliant screenplay
with an excellent plot
awesome performance and a great directing .
`` pecker '' is a great film
perhaps one of john water ' best .
a wonderful cast ,
make the story very funny ,
unfortunately this movie was not mass produced ,
superb soundtrack
excellent visual editing
beautiful prague cityscape ,
although the entire main cast is excellent
i have to single out jiri machacek for his superbly believeable portrayal of jakub
he smokes landing him in a plethora of funny situation.conclusion :
many person will not even admit they enjoyed it .
you look like an out of touch cynic.no movie is perfect
that it ruins the film.leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are wonderful .
and she held it together beautifully.jame cameron managed
the effect were bad is beyond me .
jame horner 's score was simply perfect .
and the love theme was beautiful and tragic .
too bad celine dion 's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.i confess ,
and you will not be disappointed .
and likable star melissa sagemiller .
ridiculously miscast as a priest .
but 'ss ' is rock-bottom cheap trash cinema any way
that the movie contained some `` hot '' shower scene between dushku and sagemiller .
that is so weak
carpenter 's finale is a mess of flashing light and pounding sound
and that is probably best for it .
not only is this film a `` new lesson in real bad taste
but also a lesson in `` real bad film making . ''
when a movie is terrible .
that is a new lesson in reallllllllly bad taste .
the 2 lead actress each give great emotional performance
an example of a great film
great performance of the 2 lead actress make this movie .
both girl are in one amazing emotional scene after another
i was highly disappointed in this movie .
that makes them great .
the joke are lame
that was not even funny the first time .
i advise you do not waste your time on this show .
that truly good cartoon are able to be enjoyed by the big kid
if the actual '70 had been half this funny and ( semi ) normal
they would have been so much more enjoyable.actual kid in that era did not act or behave anything close to as ight-eyed and normal as these kid did.the country 's youth was still under the influence of the hippie and the drug culture all that '60s rebellion that it spawned
the supporting cast is excellent
the sr-71 sequence - certain to have been worse than the `` air force one '' f-117 spectacle .
( cheap )
is mediocre at best for house wiring
from a `` bearing '' of 618 to 502 is just stupid .
( a massively more amazing film )
to it as well as the great innovative idea .
this could have been a great film .
from other ... it is downright horrible.that aside
the idea is great
and the format is great .
i really want it to be the fantastic film
and the fx really hurt the film overall.great movie .
it is not a great film ,
and it is probably best watched on a rainy day
there is also some great camera-work from jan de bont
subtle 'femme fatale ' performance i have ever seen .
being a pretentious mess .
something terrible is boiling under the surface .
where it was awarded the best foreign film of the year from the los angeles film critic association .
were the best offer
if we let her.i have given this film 4/10 purely for the fact
'the shawshank redemption ' rank at the top of my all-time favorite movie .
for which he is doing some research at a grocery store in a poor neighborhood in la .
although she plays it beautifully
funny
freeman and vega pull it off beautifully ,
unbelievably awful film .
it was so bad
that is actually original or refreshing .
it is an incredibly stupid premise
the good guy are a bunch of pathetic stereotype ,
( and far more loved ) captain churchill .
the other annoying character include a typical cowboy-style and trigger happy macho pilot
`` bloodsucker '' is an irredeemably stupid film ,
it only gets intolerably boring
when the frustrated soldier blame the captain for the umpteenth time and bla bla bla .
this film is a non-stop series of lame clich\u00e9s and uncreative idea ,
and let herself have some fun
and try and enjoy what is supposed to be the most fun night of their life .
but i have to admit i was quite disappointed .
`` prom night '' suffer from the worst affliction a horror movie could have ,
it all just seemed very bland.a lot of person seem to complain with the fact
the tension and suspense here is mild at best ,
however predictable the unfolding may be .
it is mediocre at best .
`` prom night '' was a disappointment .
and predictable ,
but it was far too predictable for my taste .
and left the theater very disappointed .
3/10 .
alfred hitchcok is not my favorite director by any mean
john garfield is as almost always excellent
than a love story.it is fun to watch for garfield
but it is not awfully good .
not exactly the perfect date movie
( although we both enjoyed it ) .
and is beautifully filmed .
after solid turn in girl can not help it
until fox could drop her contract at the earliest opportunity.this movie really is a diabolical waste of everyone 's time with the exception of suzy parker
who is the only thing in this movie bad enough for the material .
she can only do her best with the material .
it is more depressing than funny .
laughable and used in such an over-emphasized way
that you can not deny their terrible existance.the acting redefine the term `` terrible overacting '' at the hand of meg foster and richard joseph paul ,
first is the excellent casting of carel `` lurch '' struycken as the mysterious psychic gaunt ,
if terrible ,
about 1 every 10 joke actually manages to be funny
( the iron / phone one is probably my favorite ) .
there is also some wonderful full-frontal nudity
is the best thing on this planet
that the intentionally stupid title song is actually pretty damn catchy !
wonderfully casted
and superbly acted across the board .
was the best
but do not let any crude and/or heartless and cynical review nor the film 's pathetic pr prevent you from partaking in the best time
it is all right.a truly watchable especially with light mood i enjoyed this at home with coke and peanut .
my rating for this is 8/10
no wonder left wing critic roger ebert loved this movie ;
what a wasted opportunity !
one of the best kabuki actor alive ,
and there is no hiding how lame everything look .
the wolf-man minion look like a poor man 's wookie .
the music is cheap synthesiser stuff
our nominal hero is bland and forgettable .
there is no indication this poor soul did anything
his makes short work of the horde of bad guy
how on earth this movie got > 400 vote as a perfect 10 is beyond me .
excellent performance by jane fonda and robert deniro
and a haunting musical score makes for a most enjoyable and rewarding experience .
and sometimes not even funny .
the only true funny part are the quick spoofs on the nike basketball spot
very unfunny was the take off of charlie 's angel ,
making the spoofs more enjoyable.one thing though
this film has to be one of the greatest ... ... .. in cinematic history .
his knowledge of the music of the courtesan gharanas is incredible
lion king 1 1/2 is one of the best sequel ever
as if not the best out of the three lion king movie !
filled with wonderful new character like timon 's ma
my favorite character was uncle max
because he was very funney
filled with wonderful character
and story and music lion king 1 1/2 is in my opinion the best of any sequel and better than simba 's pride
lion king 1 1/2 is a great disney
10/10 !
full moon high try so hard to be funny and fails miserably
this film is fun ,
john cusack is wonderful as a droll
and the beautiful marisa tomei is superb as his love interest .
she not only possesses fantastic comic timing ,
i especially enjoyed the character of `` omar sharif ''
but this is not as bad
the story were not so bad either.i liked cinderella 's voice better in this too .
dreams come true a 7/10 .
since i have lived in the uk i have come to love this country but this film depicts british young person in the worst way imaginable .
but avoid it ,
the cast is also fantastic
it is great to see
its one of the best show ever made and its probably the funniest sitcom i have ever seen in my life .
that 70s show will always be the best in my eye .
you are the best ! 10/10 ...
the picture fails to make much of an impression .
best performance is turned in by murray hamilton as stewart 's partner ,
because it truly is one of the worst film i
he respects constructive criticism and so i will try to avoid bashing the film just for the sake of it and offer my opinion
as to why i found it to be so catastrophically terrible.1 .
the incredibly lame make up and special effect .
not at all creepy or haunting not even sickening just plain annoying.5 .
all dialogue was forced and terrible !
were weak as and almost like an afterthought.6 .
hopefully practice makes progress.but in the mean time avoid this like the plague .
this film is a great fun .
and it was fascinating how well norma khouri could pull everybody into her world !
and loved the movie .
it is a great film
he was evil with a great laugh and a great smile on his face.the above crime is nothing
this is alway a movie fan greatest experience
all great movie eventually rise to the top .
were fantastic .
they deserved winning the best documentary.just watch this film !
waste an hour and a half of your life
i would see a film so bad
at least as demonstrated by this worthless waste of video tape ,
when this `` film '' had redeeming value :
when something is so very bad
truly very funny .
it is just sadly humorous .
very sadly humorous .
it is incredible in that it succeeds in being terrible on so many level .
set and pseudo-medieval language are also utterly awful .
in an odd way i actually enjoyed this film ,
producing something so poor ,
that lacks any of the charm to be found in other such fantasy film .
and is the best adaptation i have ever seen .
in 1948 this was my all-time favorite movie .
what a waste.the problem start with casting nice guy tom hank in a role
that is clearly supposed to be unsympathetic .
bruce willis is badly ,
badly miscast in the role .
being obliged to deliver a lame
killing the host and guard for pleasure.the incredibly lame and cheap `` attack of the saetooth '' is one of the worst movie i
the character are awful
and not funny or pleasant
and the story is a terrible jurassik park rip-off with a bad collection of clich\u00e9s .
basically all the line and situation are poor and stupid ,
usually i am a bit of a fan of the bad eighty and early ninety film
but this film is so incredibly terrible
but never so pathetically .
this has no redeeming quality ,
this was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption .
loved the film
the first movie about the medieval time traveler was actually funny .
funny situation and of course plain absurdness ,
that would remind you a little bit of louis de funes.now this sequel has the same character
the same actor in great part and the same time traveling .
and his being clumsy / annoying / stupid or whatever
it is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke ,
it is bad .
it is really bad .
but whereas the original was so-bad-it is-ruining-my-life bad ,
this is so-bad-it is-mildly-entertaining bad .
it is annoying .
but it is still an excellent platform for character studies.if 'gideon ' was crafted more enthusiastically
mostly indifferent acting is the final straw for this weak film ,
but the rest of it is bland enough
providing a perfect target for his fellow bombardier .
with moment of subtle poignancy
are fantastic artist and even better person .
in this truly fascinating
( the intertitle express this beautifully
some of the scene are incredible
and ends up in the 'wasteland ' at the edge of the town ,
there are so many other thing to say about this incredible film .
paul wegener was an amazing actor and director
it is one of the best ever
become boring .
.heath ledger does an amazing job of impersonating australia 's most notorious outlaw .
that it almost feel rushed.unfortunately ,
but unfortunately ,
annoyingly
especially when i watch a great touching and tear-jerking movie .
if you want a `` alien in the frozen waste '' story ,
this is stupid .
and also counting in his rather disappointing production `` supersize me '' i did not had my hope up high .
sadly enough this movie disappointed me none the less .
but the rest of the playtime gets filled with rather pointless stuff and re-repeating stuff
but this canadian gem makes it hilarious .
but that is where even more problem begin.i loved this film ,
poor effect and bad acting
but a bad story with good acting and good effect is still a bad movie .
instantly dated visual effect and crummy dialogue abound in this cheesy lamer ,
which did nothing but make me pine for the day of 'the incredible shrinking man ' ,
so you can find part of it funny .
and horrible story make this movie nothing more than a low-budget disaster .
but this movie fails so horribly there was no chance to rebound.if
not only does this film look cheap ,
it is cheap
and feel of a bad student film
and it is chock full of annoying historical inaccuracy .
if you are going to make a boring film ,
to make a movie this lousy .
i thought the film was excellent
the plot was excellently paced ,
and their motivation made logical rational sense in the framework of the story.the camera-work was great
the background music perfectly
was a wonderful touch too
the best thing
this was bad .
the script was especially bad .
the technical concept were bad .
the `` suspenseful '' plot was bad .
the dialog was bad .
avoid at all cost .
you are obligated to waste about 80 minute of your life
the saving grace of this oddity include a surprisingly apt social commentary on sixty value along with a number of relatively well
beautiful full-length technicolor film .
just how good it looks is amazing.kudos for that have to go out to director richard boleslowski
to give us one of the best-looking film of the classic-era age.i
excellent in the first half
'' with jimmy stewart and margaret sullivan.the beautiful direction
i will remember best about this movie
that with such a great cast ,
avoid at all cost .
only a movie this ludicrously awful could inspire the similar `` showgirls . ''
that every person in the movie is totally unsympathetic
because they are either mind-numbingly stupid
but it is ( unintentionally ) funny as hell though .
if you are a fan of bad
and way too formulaic.this is one of the most visually beautiful film i have seen in a while ,
mother night is one of my favorite novel
and going to see this i was expecting a huge disappointment .
that perfectly portrays the irony
and above all else the crushing sadness of vonnegut 's novel.this is certainly nolte 's best preformance to date .
is without a doubt in my mind one of the best film ever made .
it is a beautiful poetic story
this actually would have been a great title for the boris karloff collection instead !
set in dr. jano rukh 's carpathian castle is pretty boring
are fundamental for the rest of the film .
the third and final act is obviously the best and most horrific one ,
boris karloff is truly fantastic
stupid
money grubbing waste of time movie that suck .
and manages to get the most stupid ,
that make person feel funny
she even looks that great in the outfit .
because this effort was just pathetic.the bottom line is skip it .
twenty minute of this and they will be singing a choir.1/10 ,
one of the best theater director this country ever had ,
that shows new orlean at its best .
is enjoyable thank to mr. kazan 's direction and the excellent cast working in the movie .
this movie is achingly beautiful .
the voice acting was particularly bland and detracted from the movie as a whole .
( undoubtedly one of the best on our contemporary pop scene ,
no one can blame him .
the pace is dull .
for every appearance of the murderer is accompagnied by a tedious menacing melody ,
intensive care is a bad movie ,
that he was the best actor to play superman yet ,
in ief : - dialog often weak
and tried feeding us poor saps the resulting mess
while not absolutely terrible ,
how could it be worse more you ask ?
not funny at all .
only if a movie is rally bad .
( awful )
a waste of money and your time !
not funny at all .
only if a movie is rally bad .
( awful )
a waste of money and your time !
not funny at all .
only if a movie is rally bad .
( awful )
a waste of money and your time !
one day mr sugiyama sees a beautiful girl
we got to see a bunch of lame aspiring actor
you are not stupid ''
`` horrible person '' ought to be the subtitle of this horrible film .
doing dull thing ,
presumably because leigh thing that all of us are as ineffective and pathetic as his actor ,
and should be on greatest hit .
it even has all of the great actor and actress in this game like pierce bronsan as once again jame bond
as the greatest jame bond game around.i give this a 10/10
it was not so bad
with some dull part .
what it is about this movie- director sam mraovich somehow messed up just about every little aspect in this movie .
without a doubt 'the worst movie ever made ' .
but this somehow eaks what i considered bad into something much more hard to imagine.everything in this movie
but the single funniest thing is that mraovich himself considers this to be a great movie.oh wow ...
it was very poor .
who enjoy a solid action film ,
awarding this film a very harsh 1/10 ,
although i do not remember a great deal about the program
most notable were the unforgettable title .
but barrier was a surprisingly 'adult ' child 's drama .
benedict taylor was excellent as billy
there is beautiful picture especially of the lake and the nature
the message of the film was not mere introspection about the director twisted relation toward woman .
bestselling writer george plimpton
though there is a quite funny sequence of arbuckle in drag flirting with buster
we see the great stone face smile and laugh in the movie !
the movie themselves were pretty bad
he was a great guy ) .
very funny and absolutely riveting .
and there is never a dull moment .
that aside this is just great .
neither does the scriptall in all it is an enjoyable b movie -
because the next generation learns the bad idea ,
is still one of the very best .
unfortunately
the landing party has never been of great interest to me .
the cook is a great character
is thus real and less fun .
the choice is there is and with regard to this movie its your ... not recommended but not entirely bad either .
let alone one of the greatest achievement in cinema history .
because a movie is about mafias/drug trade/criminal group does not automatically make it a great movie ,
because it really gives you the feel of the time the film was set in.\\all the wonderful character that existed
to sudden victory makes waste .
one of the worst this
longoria is beautiful and funny
a funny thespian
is totally wasted .
nothing can turn a mindless script and terrible direction into a winner ,
which is still the single greatest western ever made .
so perfection is not everything .
the far country has one amazing moment .
he is absolutely amazing :
what a great
great director .
and his six western as an ensemble are the best ever done by anyone
we all loved jj 's dynamite and his antic .
this is a confused and incoherent mess of interminable scene of boring dialogue and monologue .
( certainly a slaughter house is the best place for a pleasant little chat ) ,
but everything on the movie is wasted due to fassbinder 's self- indulgence .
( very cheaply )
it was a joke and the cover of the dvd looked pathetic ,
she is definitely the worst ) .
the `` story '' is to stupid to be summed up
he is extremely bad as well .
dennis hopper is the bad guy
a major disappointment .
this was one of the best uk crime drama / detective show from the 90 's
which developed the fascinating title character
and had to live it out with nun who at first loved him and then later hated him
was it supposed to be funny ?
instead of half the mess on tv now a day.i also love the show
`` this is a really bad porn flick
but the acting is horrendously bad.then
bad script seldom make sense at all.the director/writer seems to have thought
this was funnier than the only other spoof of the soap opera world
soapdish is funnier with a daffy script and plenty of laugh-out-loud one-liner and terrific performance by field
sadly it is a guilty pleasure .
it is pretty bad .
jerry does a horrible job of what i think
it is more enjoyable than this.2/10
the performance are solid
you are a bad person . ''
of how a man ahead of his time - the great 19th century american poet and humanist walt whitman - made a significan not contribution
excellent director
that throbbed in my temple for hour after i watched this turkey.disjointed and unfunny in an attempt
that should be avoided at all cost .
you have here one of those rare film
that does not contain a single redeeming quality .
but he is too cheap
the best hindi movie i have seen to date .
all the character were perfectly cast
no one country is depicted as good or bad .
the cinematography is excellent
all were perfectly cast .
it is a terrible shame
the dance and the enthusiasm of the player all make this a fun film to watch .
my dad actually recommended me to get it .
what a great role model
well this movie is pretty good and great to rent
this is not gut-busting funny .
it has its moment but not as funny as there is something about mary .
this has to be the worst piece of garbage i
cliche-ridden and boring .
but it was funny
pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was.i may not have paid cash
because singleton does a great job at presenting the esoteric conflict and the interpersonal relationship .
one of the most pointless and blatantly stupid sequel
or worst
worst of all
and what might have happened to that poor family .
just an unbelievable and ridiculous set-up
it is cheap .
but even more shocking is the uncharacteristically bad script
how bad could it possibly be ?
it is so unintentionally funny ,
the acting is just as bad .
avoid 'the hill have eye ii ' like the plague .
beautiful actress joey wang/wong is the ghost
who collects human soul for herself/itself with the help of her beautiful ghost .
which all have incredible visual and kinetic power in their action scene .
which is lightened by the strong presence of the beautiful and good willing ghost .
they are and look gratuitous or stupid
chinese ghost story is very beautiful and visually eath taking piece of eastern cinema ,
is very beautiful and hopefully earned some award in the hong kong film award back then .
i give chinese ghost story 7/10
this would without a doubt be almost perfect masterpiece of the fantasy genre .
but there are also some ridiculous question
before - so it could not get any worse !
i loved the plot of the movie .
it was a great idea
and even as that it fails to deliver .
'' flop '' etc..the best thing about the movie is the cover art .
i was completely engrossed from start to finish.the cast is excellent with kenneth branagh
she is the best ophelia i have seen
and was simply wonderful .
i especially enjoyed the sparring between hamlet and the gravedigger
this is as close to perfection
incredible .
the stupidity in this movie would shame even ed wood
if the first part in the series had mediocre dialog
and the second one had bad dialog ,
amazing .
that it is not even funny any more ,
the first time i saw this `` film '' i loved it .
were funny ,
joe pesci did an excellent job as the toughie
the dancing is perfect ,
this two-parter was excellent - the best
some superb alien in the ood - the best `` new '' alien the revived series has come up with
and some top-drawer special effects.i loved every minute of this .
it is a surprisingly funny satire of the building up of celeity .
( the wonderfully deadpan frank mchugh )
( another great fast-talking deadpan comic actor of the 1930s )
the movieunfortunately all but drop glenda farrell ,
this was one of the most ridiculous
and badly directed movie i have seen in a very long time .
bad mistake .
what it really did was center around the most boring character
what is even more ridiculous is spike lee 's choice
it makes them even worse off .
and do not waste your time or money on this loser .
waste of film
i gave it a 1/10 :
awful dud .
it was a cool fun movie.dolph
looked superbly cool on the bike.he also looked good in this movie
and the other actor were also passable.i would not call this movie his best
the third problem was that the bad guy were very few in number .
there should have been more bad guy .
enjoyed it.i would recommend other to watch it .
how great it is or what it is about ... my point is :
that since this is one of my favorite guilty pleasure ,
and created beautiful music .
while the movie and acting is pretty bad ,
this movie is still a fun one to watch at night and even dance too .
that sounded lame.9/10
beautiful attract excellent idea ,
but ruined with a bad selection of the actor .
all the other become more boring and boring .
cat is the main character is wonderful .
this movie is juvenile and boring.you can also tell in part that funding was lacking ,
even worse than the worst david lynch `` confusathon '' ,
shamefully wasted talent
that lame state sheet the movie provides us with to say
we get helipad-day and then mess hall-day later on .
was responsible for one of the worst ending in film history ?
this movie is a crappy and forgettable sean connery vehicle .
and the usually solid ed harris .
the movie absolutely gets worse
the movie squanders an excellent
the scripting and direction are extremely poor .
and ridiculous .
2/10 avoid it .
however beautiful
watching for the beautiful footage and the fact
it was awful ,
and absolutely not funny ... i will not talk more about this movie
it will be a waste of time and money .
looks great .
there are some pretty darn funny sex scene with some pretty darn attractive girl ,
there is something refreshing
-- the acting is not bad ,
without resorting to cheap exploitation .
was how it was clearly trying to emulate the `` stupid kid have sex
but there was great
if you take out the smutty humour about the othel and the `` poorer '' actor in those scene ,
then this movie is solid stuff .
but in no mean bad at all .
nick nolte gives an excellent performance in kurt vonnegut 's dark tale .
nolte is fantastic - self assured
( 7/10 )
hamlet is by far my favorite of all of shakespeare 's work .
his portrayal of this was just amazing .
for as long as it was it is rare for a film
which make a film great .
besides being boring ,
but fell flat with its message .
what were the redeeming quality ? ?
i loved
the cinematography is a beautiful ,
and had a great time laughing .
does have a sexy body and perfect figure !
mtf is definitely on my list of top 10 favorite film of all time .
few have been bestowed with as many academy award accolade in a warm up for happy hour .
the studio is on its best behaviour during this much lauded tour of the great studio and of hollywood itself
is certainly an enjoyable farce ,
but fun great navy story intertwined with young ambitious navy boy good for late burst of wartime morale ,
but it is a square solid lump of sugar
7/10
so the average idiot american moviegoer does not get bored.this anime is not perfect ,
as best i can tell .
sadly
bad script
bad direction
cheesy overdone acting and generally bad horror.from
it is boring
that are supposed to be funny ,
that are so poorly done you feel
the mark so badly here ,
they were either intelligently made and/or thought provoking or cheap and laughable cheese .
the best of its kind and we should be grateful
that worked surprisingly well
to make matter worse
and fun exploration of sexual politic .
oberon was no great shake as an actress ,
and then you are just swept away in a bad montage
quite funny but misguided .
bad acting
which i personally find quite funny .
i found `` ringmaster '' to be the funniest movie i
she is excellent ,
to avoid starvation .
avoid `` taboo '' like leprosy ,
despite this step lively remains the best sinatra musical of the forty on one tenth the budget .
they have no respect.seriously this film should be avoided at all cost .
the rest of the film is pointless for in committing such an act of violence to film clay not only damns young person
very very very predictable movie .
iq is a wonderfully original romantic comedy
that pits the greatest and deepest-thinking scientific mind of the 20th century as cupid 's helper .
because part of the time you are seeing great scientist do silly thing
the end result is a fun movie with surprise throughout .
walter matthau is a perfect einstein ,
and tim robbin ings to life the contradiction of a poorly educated working man
do not waste your time.my grade :
this movie is horrible .
the acting is a waste basket .
though the scenery is great .
you would expect a great performance ,
they are dreaming of having kareena kapoor in bed naked with a condom .
but i really liked it.i am forced to give it a 1/10 ,
then the professor wants to try out his new potion ... a very funny little film .
and take on new adventure with pikachu and other pokemon favorite .
that there was no real budget for this cheap knock-off .
the story is taken from great movie like `` texas chainsaw massacre ''
the actor are really bad ,
and the music is stupid and totally misplaced .
the so-called bad guy are also not interesting at all and rather stereotypical .
although it is rather cheap
and the action is executed very poorly .
mediocre overall.it starts with a woman
to give us a faceful of horrible idea and image ,
to make the best show
when she exudes sadness.the sex scene were fascinating and taboo-eaking .
that emerges as the film progresses.the ending is weak .
but this goes down in the category of his not so great work along with doa 2 and 3 ,
and a half of a kid screaming for no real reason completely annoying
it lacks any originality
to be something great .
not bad for a horror/comedy film .
at this film.9/10
the three best tv-spoofing movie are this one
really funny.i wonder what ever did become of ken shapiro .
there is nothing redeeming about this film .
the writing is terrible ,
between being a bad version of repo man and a nicklodeon western and the acting is unbelievable .
that this film is about the worst i
who 's a bad version of the celtic soul eater ,
although he functions more like a male succubus
is the best part .
unless you are into bad mythology ,
unconvincing acting and tedious setting ,
you will best be served by leaving this one on the shelf
bad acting .
bad writing .
this was a poorly written film .
it is too bad
if it was really as bad
that were awful about this `` movie '' i
that he enjoyed watching dreyfuss 's girlfriend
not funny .
that mildly funny ?
not only am i disappointed in dreyfuss
but i am also extremely disappointed in jeff goldblum
find remotely enjoyable about this ?
now that i have wasted 93 minute watching this trash
everyone on this planet would never here of this ridiculous waste of 93 minute out of my life
i have yet to top a worst movie i
it is honor as the worst movie ever .
is perfectly cast in a role
that both movie are superb example of the genre ,
and still enjoyed the chemistry and the timing and the mean
the movie itself is a collection of lame action sequence
( bad )
i enjoyed the film
it is good clean fun
glenn close is fantastic
bad performance .
is not too bad either .
richard brier is pitch-perfect as the conniving polonius ;
there is not a wasted moment in the entire film .
it is arguably the greatest shakespearean adaptation ever filmed \u0096 strong praise
the cat in the hat is still a terrible movie .
the beautiful kelly preston and the always likeable
even though preston is almost too beautiful for a role like this .
82 minute of personal anger and strife.the cat in the hat may be the worst kid movie ever .
too may pointless character and subplot
it gets boring after awhile ,
it could have been a great
hard political thriller instead of a jumbled mess
that loses any message in a sea of bad writing and acting
3/10* / * * * *
i am very disappointed with `` k-911 . ''
this movie is bad from beginning to end
and not particularly worse or better in any part .
very funny
and enjoyed it thoroughly.great writing and direction
excellent and believable interaction among the cast ,
and great comic timing as well.this movie touch on theme
to be the best underground date movie of the year ...
it really is a great film .
a small film noir picture
a dark film noir woven from the very same faic of welleian mythos
perhaps the crowning jewel of the film noir
shangai is still one of the best film noir pictures one is likely to discover .
and it was the same with this one.the story was pretty awful too ,
that i rather enjoyed near the end
but as a whole this movie is pretty terrible .
the character seem almost cheapened by the poorly written storyline
and so the movie fails to really draw you in .
bad
bad .
it is like watching a painfully dull home movie.i really enjoy his other film ... ...
watching a bunch of ant sting their victim is not very terrifying.spoiler section the stupidity of the hero is near incredible .
this movie is extremely lame .
to avoid .
even a stupid b movie will usually make me laugh
which was so awful i
anyway this movie had poor plot development
terrible story ,
and i am sorry to say pretty bad acting .
it is amazing
lame romantic comedy movie into the wastebasket !
and they are just as boring now
all in all i give it 4 for a great idea ,
making fundamental .
this is an excellent film for female body-builder and female action fan !
that sue price did a great job in this film series
and proved to be a great fighter .
though not a film of great value and sue price 's acting skill not the best to have met in my life ,
a priceless gem for fan of female body-builder action !
to show us the best
i really enjoyed that film
-- the acting is not all that bad ,
this was a painful example of a cheap
boring and unoriginal show
the writing was truly terrible
responsible for the worst australian film in recent memory
the honerable wally norman.nothing about this tv series was funny - ever -
it was just tired and bad and
worst of all ,
it was funny .
being given 10/10 on imdb .
that are funnier than this show .
avoid the show at all cost
is so lame ,
does not even have any redeeming quality ,
is one of the best reason
that horse lather sure looked awful phony to me and the obvious tire track in those desert tracking moments- just lazy .
too bad .
was disappointed then
while the original `` grease '' is not a great film ,
that dull mystery will linger long after the ludicrous luau finale fade into a bad memory .
although lorna luft does rise slightly above the lame material.reviewer have complained
worse film have been inflicted on audience ,
unfortunately
`` grease 2 '' is not even unintentionally funny .
the next scene plunges into even worse carnage .
poorly directed ,
poorly written ,
poorly acted ,
utterly devoid of any art direction and completely annoying .
the inclusion of that rambling freak `` ramtha '' in this film is reason enough to avoid it .
and what a total waste of my time and money this movie was .
the writing is superb ,
it is also backed by a beautiful soundtrack with local talent and an exceptional composer.all in all ,
a rare gem
it is so boring ,
bad played and in nearly every detail stolen from `` blair witch project ''
i actually could not separate the art of goldsworthy with camera path of riedelsheimer.wonderful .
wonderful .
wonderful .
stupid child with more money and time then sense.i have no idea
what great truth the viewer is supposed to take away from this film .
to play a stupid practical joke on elderly person .
your so stupid
and loved to be lied to by the medium !
concerned this silent version of the merry widow is the worst version ever made .
i like my romance light and beautiful
not a single square of space is wasted.so many illiant scene abound ,
( 10/10 ) .
obnoxious eva longorium dies on her wedding day when an ice sculpture of an angel
who can see her.obvious unoriginal movie would not be bad in a clich\u00e9d sort of way ,
that she drains all of the fun out of the film .
its the god awful script
its just really really stupid .
really put their all into some of their best role in year
which is rare enough
a funny comedy from beginning to end !
but it is also loaded with many subtle comedic moment
i thoroughly enjoyed it !
it is as if he has visualized a dirty and worn out notebook full of great little idea
in weirdness in comedy vs drama is perfectly weighed .
the music is great
makes it very pleasant and surprisingly entertaining ,
the prince was in an aircraft of some sort.- fun fact 1 :
went to in the 8th grade.- fun fact 3 :
fly away with or drag away their prey based only on a close reading of the next few page of the script.- fun medical fact :
luckily the wobbling dispelled any concern over its weight.- best line of the movie :
annoying was more like it .
when you get caught up in a great movie or tv show
frustrating and simply not fun to watch .
but it was so illiantly done that its arguably the best series finale ever .
that this thing is truly ridiculous .
in gambling addiction to behave so stupidly
highly predictable
unrealistic and sometimes even stupid .
endless look at great male and female muscle and very good photography of the spectacular hawaiian scenery .
1. you will feel sick every two minute at the sheer stupidity and silliness of how the show presents hotel business or
luke looks boring
this would have been as perfect as episode 4 and 5 ,
9/10 .
is all three and worse )
i was horribly disappointed.the storyline was
does not sound too bad
extremely annoying ,
they are not too bad
the beautiful
curious teenager has 'all grown up ' into a bland
boring wife and mother ,
it could have been worse-it is not as bad as certain other sequel
this movie is soooo funny ! ! !
the acting is wonderful ,
the joke are subtle ,
i absolutely loved the soundtrack as well
( without all the annoying song ) .
highly recommended for both the family
that are funnier with age and experience .
so that it lacks a little continuity
it is a great flick for kid
but is neither the greatest fighter nor the most demonic lover .
obnoxious but illiant ,
i love film noir ,
but this one was a real disappointment .
i loved it .
she is not given the best script in the world
alan rickman is great
but he plays the role beautifully .
she is absolutely fantastic as always .
you have seen the best movie
it is easy to be able to base all other movie off of the worst movie ever made
( and this is it ... a 1 at best ) .
based on this worst ... .i
this filmed presentation of `` the rime of the ancient mariner '' is a most beautiful and interesting rendition of coleridge 's haunting poem .
and michael redgrave 's superb narration
to view this excellent visual work.in the age of television ,
and to learn the value of great poetry .
to the best of my knowledge
this kind of work is indeed rare ;
because this is one hell of a bad movie .
fan of the completely terrible `` shrek '' might enjoy ,
nearly every single character is awful ,
but everything else about the movie is dull
dull
dull ! ! !
it is just terrible .
it is not as bad as `` shrek . ''
this is one of the worst movie
predictable .
it will make a great gift for person
showing another father-son camaraderie.brilliant star-cast leading with tom hank
has done a terrific job.great
is an acting legend.great acting too from paul newman
jude law and daniel craig.casting is just too good.the plot is quite good.you will enjoy the movie.a great portrayal of the gangster of the 1930's.set in the 1930 's ,
this will surely stand out as the zenith of all gangster movie of that era.soundtrack is pretty good an apt to the movie.a great flick in totality
excitement and a great hero as well .
and the unforgettable rat/bat/spider .
this was surprisingly intelligent for a tv movie
and the performance by mare winningham and alison lohman were great .
she is great .
`` hatred of a minute '' is a hauntingly beautiful film .
strong performance and excellent cinematography make this film a `` must see '' for any film student or horror fan .
this is television excellence at its best .
and it is beautifully filmed in black and white
almost a film noir style with its deep shadow and stark image .
it is a rare presentation of what homosexual faced in the 1960 in america .
written by the superb tom pettit ,
and directed by the great jeannot szwarc
beautiful .
( and the wonderful folk at pixar of course )
humourous story combined with the best of computer animation .
but background were superb and animation was eathtaking .
`` the groove tube '' is one of the most unfunny
unclever and downright horrible film ever made .
after all.this film is not even `` good '' bad or `` enjoyable '' bad .
but this film is so bad ,
so poorly made
acted and scripted and so incredible stale ,
but this film is worse than the worst snl skit you can find .
that is bad .
but poorly-filmed east from 1974 are not going to excite anyone these day .
truthfully this film is so poorly made
is easily the best thing in this horrible film .
not that the `` dancing man '' sequence is that great
while not so great itself ,
it is amazing
the acting is superb .
it is my favorite movie of all time .
to replace poor jan 's crushed body -
and acting that polarizes at wooden or over-the-top.this is a great party film ,
and it is damn fun to watch !
the one-liner are the best .
this is not a bad movie
the performance from burt reynold and dom deluise are great ,
unfortunately
the animation in this movie is great ,
the voice work is great ,
if there is one redeeming feature to this film ,
it fits perfectly .
and unbelievably bad all at the same time.i enjoyed part of this movie ,
it was so bad i looked it up on imdb
who enjoyed this fluff .
sadly
( on numerous cheap dvd compilation )
i gave this flick a 4/10 .
i can fault in this production is the somewhat annoying voice
it was the worst
why dose the movie have all those cheap crappy scare in it in the beginning
also it had a couple funny part and kill like
but the rest was great
as oken hero in a bad
at least for some of us.the three main character are amazing .
de niro has done one of his best job
this was his best performance ever .
and the dialogue is often too weak .
has got to be one of the worst yet .
( w=waste )
and the material is funnier
rosetta lanoire ,
is great in a small role.the
or just plain bad manner
played by the wonderful hugh laurie .
it is the funniest thing
four wedding and a funeral .
black adder is funny and almost too good for television .
because this serial features the bar-none best theme song of any serial
-- and the best version of yakima canutt 's famous stagecoach stunt .
it is incredible ,
and worse still ,
is often cited by fan as the best of the series ;
and there are some great action sequence !
) .the film 's most exciting moment come in the form of a wonderful underwater fight between tarzan and a crocodile
the violence is surprisingly nasty at time ,
tarzan and his mate does suffer slightly from some bad effect and unconvincing props\u0097dodgy back projection
and poorly disguised trapeze swing\u0097but these should not spoil your enjoyment of this very entertaining film .
ben chaplin 's talent are wasted in a forgettable role
it is too bad
even though it is familiar territory i still enjoyed this
it is not a bad movie ;
because they are poor white trash
and they were not very funny
after that it soon became one of the funniest comedy series
the chemistry between bill and ben 's character 's were very funny
because he was a illiant actor in film such as up 'n ' under and a very funny man ripthis underrated show has sadly disappeared from our television screen
so hungrily and with such a bittersweet mixture of anticipation and fear of disappointment
stealing most of the best line and pretty much all of the film ' funniest moment ,
subtlety goes out of the window to the detraction of the main story ... . ricky gervais ' cameo
subtle comedy and self-realisation required for a story like this where a `` humble young boy embark on life-changing quest '' ;
as yvaine is beautiful
a perfect interpretation of her stellar role ;
rollicking good fun
if you enjoyed her deliciously b ! tchy performance in the recent `` hairspray '' then you will thoroughly enjoy her in this
and you may even cry - stardust is a beautiful
one of my all-time favourite film is the absolutely fantastic princes bride ,
smart and funny twenty year after its initial release ,
the role was not good..great deal of cheapness is filled in .
i was totally disappointed with the movie .
randall is not a bad match for reynold ,
but there is also embezzlemant and cheaper wage
and try the best for their family.john goodman
a good message film about hard time right here in america .
8/10 .
! 10/10
there are no sympathetic character so
she actually looks bored having to utter all these stupid line to nic .
they are disappointing to say the least ,
just avoid this horrible mess .
i will give 3/10 star ,
excellent political thriller
the two actor gel amazingly well together ,
the final scene with each of the main character are wonderfully written and acted .
`` midnight cowboy '' was never a great movie
this was a great performance
as it is voight has seldom disappointed on screen ;
funny and sexy and recognizably 'real ' ;
there are superb vignette from the like of brenda vaccaro and sylvia mile as well as john mcgiver
beautifully delineated little character study
maybe it is a great movie after all .
but not annoyingly so
the whole film is a thing of beauty and great imagination ,
the characterisation is superb ,
and never played any of the big venues.i lay most of the blame on director michael sarne ,
and piecing the film together the best
is wasted with nothing to do.to expand it to feature length
( in amazing footage from the gang 's all here )
it was not bad to exploit them.this
which tried and failed in the worst way to duplicate its success .
as best i know ,
she looks great
`` sir '' john gielgud must have become senile to star in a mess of a movie like this one .
or is that bad smell coming from dayeak 1 + 2 ?
this film is really bad
the special effect are also bad
( not the worst one i have seen
and the music is so bad
one of the worst film i have ever seen .
disappointing and undeniably dull true-crime movie
that has poorly cast character actor jeremy renner languidly mumbling his way through the title role of jeffrey dahmer ,
boring ,
badly acted and virtually bloodless snore-fest of a true-crime drama
like it had the perfectly good potential
that it is one of the worst serial-killer biopic ever done !
it is even sorrier than other pathetic and exploitive straight-to-video trash like `` gacy ''
it is greatest flaw is its predictibability and utter lack of suspense .
funny
the name uwe boll is automatically linked to bad horror/cult cinema and every new movie
uwe boll is a terrible writer/director and quite frankly a menace to the entire film-making industry .
but basically it is just another umpteenth dull slasher with an indestructible killer and video game violence .
the first 45 minute of `` seed '' are beyond boring
boll was stupid enough
the senseless plot twist and complete lack of story depth of this movie go way past being just bad ;
they are downright infuriating and insulting the intelligence level of the average horror movie fanatic .
multiple twist and sub plot in `` seed '' are simply impossible to accept by the reasonable functioning human mind
just for the fun of upsetting person ,
this sequence masterfully epitomizes how pathetic and wannabe controversial the whole film in fact is .
the `` why god why '' bit was cringe worthy in it is badness though )
if they had not had the intellect of any given `` home alone '' baddie ,
was immensely fun ) .
i voted this a 10/10
because it is the best animated story i
the artwork behind each and every landscape was beautiful .
this is just dull intellectualism ,
without even renting it or anything ... this movie was so horrible ,
the acting was not that bad ,
the story was horrible ,
was an awful device
it was a horrible movie ,
and still gems like this do not get a shot at recapturing their past glory .
this film is nothing less than a film-historic gem
bug goes all obnoxious on him
john stamos is a great actor .
john stamos does a great job portraying his character .
bob saget is also a great actor .
he is great .
playing the character of joey was perfect for him .
he does a great job
she is one of the best
incredibly amazing !
her great look and absolutely amazing acting ability helped to make the show the success
could hit every line perfectly .
she showed great enthusiasm .
is my favorite character in full house.mary-kate and ashley olsen
great actress .
jodie and candice were much better at acting.full house is a great show for everyone .
is that everyone can live a great life even if a tragedy
shown in this movie belong in a bad psychodrama
- bad preteen sex - bad emotional battering - bad animal cruelty - bad psychological torture - bad parental neglect - bad the only merit
if any is the excellent color shot of contrasting red
blond and green leaves a bad feeling for anyone
what a bad mistake to make ,
i rated cube a 10/10 ,
hypercube was a massive disappointment .
i rated it a 5/10.the third movie
because the watcher are just part of the big bad experiment ,
that is just flippin ' stupid .
and acting in cube zero are not too bad ,
that this movie can only get from me a rating of 3/10 .
which is downright dreadful !
and emerging the most annoying of the lot !
the revelation proves a surprisingly elaborate one
one of the more enjoyable aspect of asian cinema
in its own right as fascinating as any other genre-based whodunit
and the print is beautiful
thoughtful analysis these gem truly deserve .
( and greatly appreciated second look )
who has already experienced catastrophe this year with the dreadful `` william shakespeare 's a midsummer night dream .
unlike the much worse 1997 film
is it too much to ask for that same type of thing in this comedy-which is seldom funny
the overall production design is nothing but a mess of incomplete sight gag and consist of one joke :
who surly had lot of fun .
and the actor certainly had fun time with all the gizmos and prop ,
i would like to state that `` inspector gadget '' is an awful ,
i have loved this movie ever
it never fails to make me laugh or cheer me up
the three lead are fantastic
something about how funny the next line it .
i loved it more than part i
it started off with a bang \u0096 the best clark kent to superman transformation and rescue scene .
unfortunately ,
was the great superman change scene
as was the wonderful recap of part i in s2t 's opening .
the special effect were not great in either part i or s2t ,
they were mostly downright laughable \u0096 such as lois falling from the daily planet window .
( spoiler alert ) unfortunately ,
the worst change comes last :
( with some especially funny scene ) .
that the film could be about being indecisive and avoiding responsibility - a sort of fear of growing up .
although the story is mildly funny ,
1st watched 2/28/2006 - 4/10
this is not a horrible show ,
just because the series is ending does not mean that they have to get rid of some great character !
the villain ' motive are pretty bad
they are awful .
many villain look stupid
and killer croc are among the worst ) .
some episode are great- over the edge
all of the crossover featuring batman in the superman animated series were great ,
also.the absolute worst part about this show is how the creator say
it is not a bad show ,
the animated series are great follow-up show to batman :
( played by the great richard o ' sullivan )
in particular getting some of the best line of the series .
brodie could never turn down a dare and loved attention ,
this movie is not only a very bad movie
with awful actor
it also copies exactly an scene from the excellent `` giallio '' `` torso '' ,
the scene in rizzo 's movie is ridiculous and inferior to the softness and charming in martino 's film .
`` hickory dickory dock '' is a solid ain exercise ,
inspector japp has his funny moment
the plot is pretty weak \u0096 even though in a way
saves the poor guy 's life with the intention
****minor spoilers*** as a bad movie connoisseur i must have viewed hundred of bad movie
starts off bad and gets progressively worse
that this was a truly bad film .
that i had just seen the best
which is a continuous string of one unfunny joke after another .
that he deserves mention alongside the like of coleman francis and bill rebane as one of the worst director of all time .
how bad can a bad movie
the movie is not all that bad .
is particularly ridiculous .
that itch to just kill an hour or two doing chore and watching a movie so bad
just cause i was in the mood for a bad movie.i was not disappointed in the least.mad scientist
poorly animated
it is solid ... like a toy or something ) .
i like watching incredibly bad b-movie from time to time
still it is a great movie with even better music .
and was perfect for the part !
with many gem made by both the bbc and independent company .
never fails to deliver .
and make it enjoyable .
it is probably one of the worst film i
but i have not ticked spoiler so i will just say avoid ,
avoid avoid
dubbing is worse
this is one snoozer.pretty boring 2/10
this supernatural peter weir thriller is truly one of the most haunting and fascinating movie
richard chamberlain does his best performance here as the australian lawyer
olivia hamnett and david gulpilil are solid in the supporting role
and the worst part of the film is that martin and hawn have to `` find themselves '' ,
joe johnston surprised me with his subtle directing
because stacy was in it and i loved the movie saetooth .
even that death was stupid
the film is idiotic and a waste of time .
and had an amazing selfishness attitude ,
the bad guy is muscular with red eye ...
together by famously bad director richard friedman.the movie opens in a strip bar
the cast come across as competent actor doing what they can with a bad script and a director
the main redeeming feature is that the physical werewolf effect are rather good ,
and the design of the wolf is not bad at all.but the cgi is bad .
just plain bad .
aside from the terrible script ,
this is a really fun
but it is a wonderful sweet
refreshing movie .
one of the best of the comedy romance genre .
when i was younger i really enjoyed watching bad television .
so bland and uninspired it makes one miss star trek :
is a wonderful guilty pleasure
anchored by two solid performance by jame spader and kurt russell
a wonderful musical score ,
none of what made the film fun appears in this show .
as vanilla and dull as the script .
dumb and funny as hell .
dumbland is worth half an hour of your time .
this picture was the worst .
some of them even boring .
of the 18 different story.montmartre - kind of a dull opening sequence ,
but with a sweet heart to it.les marais - this was a huge disappointment !
everything before it is just annoying.tuilery - an entertaining sequence by the coen other .
and this one also gets you truly hooked to the movie.loin du 16ieme - a beautiful story too ,
if the execution is poor ,
i am wrong.bastille - a truly wonderful sequence .
but truly sad and beautiful !
one of the best segment !
could have been great
the story is not intriguing and not funny at all.parc monceau - a truly original and great sequence
one of the best of the movie !
and the actor are amazing !
beautiful
- a boring sequence between ardant and hoskin ,
madeleine is superb.pere-lachaise - another let-down segment .
it could have been great ,
twyker 's short film is beautiful
her french is truly terrible
the entity of the movie is great !
and directed the best comedic film to come out of new zealand for a long time .
this would not be so bad
who won best supporting actress at new zealand film award for this portrayal )
ken is as bad a tooltime tim taylor ,
it is great to see some famous new zealand faces perform in the suburban comedy
i loved the sparring between jen and lyn .
the performance are a treat and the film works perfectly .
a great way
my favorite `` imperialism '' movie and one of the best action-adventure flick of all time .
and the incredible temple scene with cutter singing and then annoucing
it had some subtle adult joke
one of the best low budget movie from germany !
while chevy chase and the gang at snl set new high with the sketch show format this fails miserably at every level .
very bad .
it still remains neither funny or acutely observed .
avoid even if curious .
sadly
the screaming and shouting german voice ... unbelievably funny .
the character are vague representation of the most boring person any of us know .
my biggest regret is not that i wasted 60 minute of my life watching `` love in the time of money '' ,
but that i missed a great opportunity
to unravel the mystery of a fundamental question of human existence :
which was also about love and memories.message of this film
in which the musical score is in perfect tandem with its images.this is one of the reason
and loved it every bit as much as the first time .
there are many great performance in this movie ,
is fantastic
in the best way
dull movie wife audience are usually forced to endure .
as to be completely predictable ,
so everything seems like a succession of random moment at bad hollywood party .
avoid .
haute couture ~ and a perfect place
is a refreshing departure from his role as lupin in the harry potter series .
great screenplay .
this film is anything but boring !
are pretty pathetic and at a certain stage
i was having just about the worst day of my life .
does not have the best video quality ,
this is just perfect .
too bad ,
my life sucks just as bad as your .
is a gem and the final scene rounds up the film to perfection .
walter matthau gives a superb performance as the irascible semi-retired comedian
superb .
but for what the film lacks in character complexity
uncharacteristically beautiful composition of early film ,
one of his best roles.the film concern two young man
the film is entirely enjoyable and enjoyably well constructed ,
this film is fantastic .
the whole thing is badly done.watch it for the script though
a small funny film .
it is totally incredible
but it is funny how an introverted masochist can become totally dependent and mesmerized ,
it is just fun to go through their procedure and foil them systematically .
funny
but stupid and boring laughing on repeated disgusting stuff .
the music and the girl are great ,
unfortunately you have to watch the whole movie
it was weak
very very weak .
the films was ridiculously over-rated at the goyas .
that shows empathy for the weaker citizen in society ,
excellent !
is beautiful ,
or rent it cheap ,
4/10
he is wasted in this film .
it also would have been much funnier
this film is terrible .
the plot is awful
the acting in most case was weak too ,
( although the editing was poor ) .
that adequately summarises how terrible this entry in the series really is .
and do not get me started on the bad.the wasted opportunity are pretty obvious ,
wasted opportunity
and used a few cheap trick to draw the audience in .
by supporting cast were fantastic.where as melinda and melinda is tiresome ,
one melinda is so dysfunctional
and so melodramatic she is laughable ,
but forgettable.woody allen 's previous ensemble movie worked
the direction of denzel washington is excellent ,
( which is rare ,
it is refreshing .
the young victorium is a beautiful film
but it was and i loved it .
and it interested me greatly.queen victorium in many light was one of our all time greatest monarchs ,
this was what inspired victorium to be a fantastic queen ,
the young victorium is a heart felt love story but at the same time a great look into a major part of british history ...
10/10 ... no doubt !
that the script or direction was bad ,
but what ms. blunt does do with the role is show the simple humanity of the character with potent subtlety .
and my favorite scene of all in the film- we see her nervous
a proposition so ridiculous for those time
and that some very fine actor were wasted with little do and little character development
i give this film a solid 7 for wonderful lead performance
what starts out as a very predictable
playing the character in a great `` aloof '' fashion ,
falling in the `` so-bad-it is-good '' category .
it also is shot so poorly with such grainy film
which supposed to be funny
until he gets it.this is a real horror film with some truly wonderful horror moments.also ,
who lacks proper knowledge of film .
ridiculous dialog ,
it fails to entertain .
it is worse than any student film i have seen.as
that lou and sassafra are the best of friend
no matter how poor the quality is .
'bill and ted 's excellent adventure '
that short story for the first time.in the case of terry gilliam 's excellent film
alone in the dark is one bad movie
about what kind of bad movie is a worse kind of bad movie .
because the director is a stupid ,
the really terribly bad horror film .
everything about it is a mess .
bad plot
insane random camera cut and appalling soundtrack.alone in the dark is a dreadful movie
and ferdie happy again.i would give this cartoon 8/10 star .
that housewife 's daytime movie and bad soap operas always are ,
and it is based in that predictable and well-trodden premise
what i got was a particularly bad christmas 'feelgood ' story
you are a fan of predictable 'housewife takes on man and win ' tv movie .
but the best
what made this film unforgettable are the great explosion picture
there follows nearly an hour of a dull arranged marriage melodrama .
unfortunately
many of these film have simply deteriorated so badly
-- a time all but forgotten today.unfortunately ,
it is also a mess .
the writing is just god-awful and a bit trashy at time
bad acting and direction and poor writing ) ,
so you can see excellent singing and tap dancing
really bad !
the polished cinematography by levie isaak boasts lot of great crazy
who are both pitch perfect ) ,
it has the best soundtrack of any movie of the last 50 year at least
and it was one of the best concert
are completely wasted by this stilted nonsense
avoid it .
is this the `` worse '' star trek tos episode ?
boring .
in the ship corridor is pretty lame .
the beginning is great ,
but it is done all very beautifully .
'de grot ' tell an amazing story stretched over more than 30 year .
like our poor
cheap ... .the character were drawn in very oad stroke
but would appreciate a bit more subtlety.of course ,
that many other seem to find some meaning or message in this picture .
what a fascinating film .
mostly the poor .
dreary and wholly pointless script ,
which drags itself lamely along and drags the viewer 's interest
but the horrible script is beyond resuscitation .
only serves to add insult to injury.this film
is nothing but a major disappointment on all level .
funny film
due to the fantastic finale and great humor ,
plus jackie chan is simply amazing in this ! .
jackie and wai-man chan had fantastic chemistry together ,
and are both very funny ! ,
however the dubbing was simply terrible ! .
and the main fight is simply fantastic ! ,
it is pretty cheap looking but generally very well made ,
plus one of my favorite moment in this film is when jackie
due to the fantastic finale
and great humor
that it is nothing great ,
jackie chan does a good job here with solid camera work
fantastic angle
jackie chan is amazing as always ,
and is amazing here ,
had fantastic chemistry with wai-man chan ,
and played this wonderful cocky character ,
he was amazing ! ,
and excellent
it has a great cast
who give superb cliche characterisation with help from the usual effective story
this movie is utterly stupid and a waste of time .
`` straighthead '' was terrible .
what an awful show .
that has ever been in a bad sci-fi series .
the story is bad .
the dialog is worse than a prime time soap opera .
and the set are awful .
caprica is a waste of film
a waste of time and a waste of effort .
you might find this gem.the human condition in modern time la .
and devastated after my first viewing of this - many part of grey garden are very funny and unbelievably surreal - documentary of not
this might be one of the greatest ever film
a hugely enjoyable pirate flick
that recalls the very best of chan 's hero buster keaton
and whilst the frequent foray into laboured comedy dull the film 's impact just a little ,
that ranks with the best of its period .
the return is not the worst movie ever made .
but failed in a pathetic or offensive manner .
the acting is as bad
the plot is terrible and predictable .
the special effect are pathetic .
some movie are so bad ,
his fear of losing funding and control become inconsequential ,
which seemingly serves verhoeven 's purpose perfectly .
and it is too bad ,
maybe that was my mistake.i tried my best to enjoy this film ,
and a more straightforward biographical approach would perhaps be better suited to covering the life story of this remarkable lady.there are fundamental mistake
3/10 from me .
as this movie is not fantastic .
are all beautiful ,
only if you are a fan of mediocre korean horror
it is a very poorly done film with a lot of violence .
i suppose it follows cheaply along the line of every slasher movie
it is just so dull .
bad editing and the whole works .
only a sad waste of time .
( ultimatum has an 85/100 on metacritic.com ,
to keep the movie from becoming bland at time .
since august 3. it is the best action movie i
damon is solid but not spectacular
very smart movie bad )
this movie is some of the worst crap i
the cgi was awful ,
and the story was just a waste of ink .
the actor try very hard to make a go of an essentially unfunny script .
after getting a quickie divorce just is not all that funny .
just seems terribly unfunny
than the script and i found myself just bored by the whole mess .
not only is this movie a great film for basic cinematography
this is the greatest film i
and makes a beautiful artistic act from these 11 short film .
it is really the weakest part of the movie ,
the 9 other are perfect
otherwise it would be a perfect 10.it seems
that every actor enjoyed their part and overacting
that will stick with you.it is a fantastic movie
this move pokes fun in all the right place .
that contained both of the great we were thrilled !
the worst film i have ever seen but worth a look for a laugh
the acting is awful the effect ...
well i could do better on my camcorder in fact its so bad they only bothered to put make up on the zombie faces and left out neck
that make no sense and terrible script !
it is great fun to watch ,
his stuff is so awful .
how bad this guy really is .
he is the worst out there.the credit would not end
as the pathetic movie started and quickly i noticed
that the audio was incredibly badly dubbed in .
the acting was incredibly awful
the editing is easily the worst .
i wasted 45 minute of my life.do not watch this crap !
r o b o t j o x.burn the master.grotesquely horrible.no ending ;
no closure.completely and utterly the worst movie ever made.replaces `` the adventure of pluto nash ''
as the worst movie of all time.i hate this utterly unacted
unproduced mess of a thing
this mess of a thing makes
those movie only bad -
not terrible horrible and grotesque like this thing .
and meets a beautiful
they are usually filled with lame actor
stupid storyline and minimal effect .
it is a movie about a poor ,
it is funny that the critic here could not get the locale straight .
and another annoying thing ... .this is the second family movie i
`` fly me to the moon '' has to be the worst animated film i
bad movie .
but there is not enough violence for my liking.the film becomes quickly boring and forgettable
a child 's tale of supernatural '' to name only a few.4/10 .
that this is the story of martinaud 's imperfection and his difficulty in coping .
this could have been one of the best summerslam 's ever
just like every match luger is in is terrible .
and yokozuna defended the world title against lex luger this match was boring
and it has a terrible ending .
however it deserves 8/10
without any funny joke !
every scene was like a bad saturday night
not very funny to begin with ,
that was just lame.and i also found the `` aquarius '' sequence totally annoying and excessive .
there is definatly no extreme violence in this boring peice of s*t. i
however its just boring boring nonsense with ton of lame slow mo flashback
avoid !
at best
which would have given it far greater depth .
the soundtrack is great ,
with such bad taste in movie ,
because it` one of the worse movie ever created .
it` so lame
so bad ,
that it becomes terribly funny .
`` man in white '' are so dumb and stupid ,
aline macmahon is of course wonderfully authoritative as the chief nurse ,
however the stunt work on this movie was excellent
( 7/10 )
section of `` the great escape
`` stripe '' was pretty darn funny i thought .
it is so unfunny ,
( awful ) .
is the lack of a great cinematographer ,
this is a bad movie .
not one of the funny bad one either .
this is a lousy bad one .
the direction was awful ,
lucy liu and mickey rourke signed on for this criminal waste of celluloid .
the script was terrible
and will only waste two hour of your life
have seen bad movie
this one is just a waste of time .
it is like a bad 80s tv show
oh my god was it bad .
the story is pretty predictable ,
there is a funny subplot
it was dreadful
and the violence was awful .
this is one of the worst movie
it is one of the worst movie i
but hostel is definitely much more worse .
this movie is more funny and ridiculous
bad actor
just some low-budget crap.i rate it 3/10
mr.tom is perfectly portrayed by john thaw as the harsh old man
the film was so excellently shot
who do not are missing out on a truly amazing and illiant film .
this is a beautiful film .
adding it to my collection of my all time favorite movies.tom hank is my favorite actor ,
i would not call this a great movie
the film is truly a great bank caper comedy
while this does save a great deal of time ,
he was not going to be playing the great emancipator
fonda was not playing the great emancipator
the great strength of young mr. lincoln is the way
lincoln will forever be a favorite subject of biographer and dramatist
that he was our president during the greatest crisis in american history
and great joke .
the acting is not that great ,
but asked for double the money thats how bad my hero 's acting and the hole thing was ... ... ... ... .i can not believe
but the use of stock footage for cut scene and for visual of the aircraft in flight is pathetic .
being assassinated is steadier and cleaner.my honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time
it was fun to see francis again ,
but it was a weak effort .
because the rest of the '50s sci-fi film were so stupid !
i wanted to see it in the first place was because i was curious about what the great henry fonda was really like at his peak .
i was not disappointed -
wonderful animation and adorable character
( even the bad guy were cute ! )
to avoid disaster .
though the film unfortunately sways from its russian root ,
nastasya is a great match ,
the film would have been lost and boring .
in this film was great .
just when your thinking its going to get boring
not too long and not too shabby.8/10
to make it the best way
they were poor ,
funny ,
it is ok to be funny
is a great little sleeper movie
to seeing this one was the earlier and somewhat disappointing 'the dead eye of london ' ,
it is great fun to watch
that throws so many weird and wonderful idea into the script
that there are so many different side to the plot does unfortunately
the atmosphere is superb
and the colour scheme on display is great too look at .
the location used are also superb
college girl murder is an excellent little mystery flick and one
that comes highly recommended !
and have reviewed a great deal of them
that this film has the single funniest scene i
as to what makes this incredibly stupid movie as funny
except it is much funnier .
he has never been funnier .
it is stupid ,
if it has the funniest scene of all time in it .
( in this amazing fur thing )
rf and garson have a wonderful evening together !
when garson wakes him from a bad dream .
my website on bad and cheesy movie
this is absolutely terrible
it is an insult upon this entire planet
jim mckay has made one of the best films
unfortunately
sollett 's constant use of close-up and one particularly bad
a solid effort in filmmaking
if victor varga were truly a great film and story ,
unfortunately
and this series is simply amazing !
it follows it very well.i give this series a 10/10 .
it has a great story
and some of the best animation i have seen .
it also has some great japanese music in it too !
this film was in one word amazing !
a beautiful ensemble of older screen gem
was amazing .
her subtle chemistry with the knight in stolen armour was great
i loved this film ,
but there are some great character here ,
mostly because there are cheap ,
brilliant .
beautiful.and salute to yasmin .
.i enjoyed the film with some reservation .
and what had actually happened.i would rate it 7/10 ,
won the oscar in 2002 for `` best animated short
which is pretentious at best and appealing to anyone
that would be funny in two of the three instance .
and the film is not quite awful enough
watching by bad film buff .
but yesterday i finally saw it on cable and ... well ... i was not disappointed ,
at her very worst :
singularly convinced of her own greatness
though poor jeanne tripplehorn seems to carry herself
and is not altogether bad
( despite winning a razzie nomination for `` worst actor '' ) ,
on whose shoulder rest the blame .
should be light and fun
it is not even bad enough for us bad-movie lover to enjoy .
do not waste your time .
which was worse :
the weakest part of the scenario is that the impossibility of seriously mentally ill patient to act like normal person
those are not the only weak part of the movie .
also appearance of togan in the very end is obviously the worst mistake
the fuss about the greatness of the movie and the interview
gen is a total disappointment .
it was so funny.both akshay kumar and john aaham are illiant actor ,
and then the other one was just so funny to watch ,
that some of his amazing work has got noticed
before you flame on me ,
turning to boxing for self-respect and anger management
i rate this 7/10 .
not even the swearing and the insult
disappointing ,
following a plane crash and the inheritance of $ 1 million by a beautiful widow .
although the plot does make perfect sense in this giallo ,
to fully appreciate all its subtlety .
whotta great outfit it is turned out to be
in its ongoing quest to ing these lost italian gem back from oblivion .
this show was great ,
when i was 13 year too just like roy.season 2 and season 3 had great comedy in there also season 3 had some of my favorite such freaky friday ,
i was disappointed
it was one the best no
it was the best family comedy show ever since home improvement
and more solid.the character had become stale as well .
tapping has done a great job
davis has done an incredible job with hammond
making him sympathetic and normal .
mad world '' is at the top of my list for all time greatest comedy ever made ,
it is a lame
lame
lame
lame comedy.rating :
the visual effect were amazing - especially for a short .
that person are under estimating this incredible film .
it would deservedly get a 1/10 but i viewed this film with a few friend
that it deserves the 10/10 for the pure entertainment of the film.the general view on this movie is that it has bad acting
that has a hilariously funny script
this was a disappointing film .
a disappointment .
or has one of the worst director in the history of film .
but i was disappointed .
the acting was weak
( at best ) ,
this was an utter waste of time .
it was a waste of film and money .
the actor are terrible ,
the accent are horrible ,
and is not funny .
although it is not trying to be funny .
i adore m. c. beaton 's book about the wonderful scottish constable .
if you love m. c. beaton 's adorable hamish macbeth do not waste your time on this rubbish .
and acting from the main character is superb
the great skill of this play is that with astute writing and fine acting a movie basically about `` two of us ''
talking can make an excellent picture .
worthy of at least an 8/10 .
one of the best comedy series to ever come out of britain .
little britain pale into insignificance as a poor imitation of their idea .
so i will reserve judgement.the original radio series from which log came was as innovative as the tv series became .
it really is annoying that we finally get a show
that not only deliver but is actually one of the best
scott mcdonald is great as jack frost ,
who becomes a snowman through some stupid accidental mix of ridiculous element .
are completely retarded but really funny .
that the rest of the cast completely over-acts just adds to stupidity of the film ,
but it is stupidity is it is genius .
of course it is only fun to watch the first few time
i gave it a 7/10 ,
this is a great movie for date and couple in the late hour .
they are going to be bad from frame one .
to add insult to the injury ,
it does not even fit in that famed `` so bad it is good '' category .
it is just plain bad .
the script is bad ,
the zombie are awful ,
line are bad ,
actor are bad.. the list
just because of its reputation of being awful .
there are bad movie
but like the best film in the genre the utality is offset by a good score and attractive photography .
so martino 's film is influential in its own right.this is a good solid giallo
gundam wing is a fun show .
the best character is zechs ,
wing has great suit design .
with the epyon being my favorite .
but sweet suit design does not quite save the series from boring character.conclusion :
enjoyable
holly is a powerful and amazing film on many different level .
it is amazing .
unfortunately
( not because this is funny ,
but chaplin at that great sense of melodrama
very beautiful bonham-carter did exactly the same thing ,
she had the most beautiful eye of cinema since jobyna ralston
many great science fiction story were written in the 50 's and some of them
i actually enjoyed this quite a bit.but
simon 's best comedy is superbly crafted by director gene sak
every new zealand film made is great .
wrong.it is completely overrated and not funny ,
the only really funny thing i
who only messed around with white woman ,
it was very disappointing .
the joke are lame at best
how ridiculous it is .
go see it for the a-to-z primer on what to avoid .
a film like amazing grace and chuck is a perfect example
he loves in an incredibly sappy and ridiculous scene.before
that this film is poorly written
how badly the film was constructed .
that go to waste .
is an incredible picture .
but that is a big part of the fun .
jim davis gives an excellent performance in this film .
it is probably one of the best role
like many of the best work of art ,
is not afraid to be subtle and ambiguous .
and leaves old food gone bad in the refrigerator !
is bad enough ,
but its more than a little ridiculous ,
only because it was so extremely bad and cartoonish
have been eating poisonous waste for decade
watching actor of some notoriety clumsily fall amidst tiny black speck is painfully funny in a not-so-good-but very-bad way .
the cast for the film is not bad on paper ,
although it is quite a bad film ,
and does have many of those seventy bad film quality - start-studded actor embarrassing themselves ,
really quite dreadful .
... this is not the first time stanley blurred the distinction between genre to such great effect
which actually yields some very funny moment .
together they made a great team
if you want a great viewing experience ,
( director of many bad moovy )
he makes one terrible actress scream and moan helplessly for about 10 minute
the film is poorly shot
in a word ... amazing.i initially was not too keen to watch pinjar
this would be another movie lamenting over the partition
that one rarely gets to see in bollywood nowaday .
no one country is depicted as good or bad .
the cinematography is excellent
everything about the movie was amazing ...
all were perfectly cast.if
you are interested in watching an intellectual and genuinely wonderful movie ...
amazing can not describe how excellent it is .
but i loved this film .
the only one i have ever given less than an 8/10
that i have given less than a 10/10
which can fairly be called an awful film .
there is not better awful film ,
if a film is amazing in a particular aspect ,
but a film can be the most amazing visual masterpiece
and have a lame or illogical story -
that just made the whole endeavor more fantastic and beautiful .
which is my favorite film .
2001 is perfectly coherent
the setting is enormously beautiful .
`` this is such a beautiful place .
that is a good thing or a bad thing .
just wanted out of the situation.the film is also simply amazing visually .
are amazing pictorially .
that are particularly amazing here .
one of the film 's greatest sequence involves the man ,
that she and the man enjoyed to themselves -
it - is almost offensively cheap .
but they were awful at the time .
they can still be awful now .
10/10 .
it is an excellent mystery movie soaked in wit .
he gets the best line of deathtrap ,
which he executes perfectly :
juggle comedy and drama in a surprisingly strong performance
that is one of my favorite comedy - noise off .
( perfect stranger ) .
that they are many subtle joke
even 10 minute is too much to waste on enid-blyton-meets-struggling-wanna-be-artist .
slasher are always supposed to be bad ,
and put it somewhere on the list of characters.the motive is just lame
no fair ! really one of the most awful movie i have ever seen.i could enjoy myself more by watching a lindsay lohan-movie
but to my surprise i really enjoyed this .
either that or he was given lousy role
but i enjoyed this the most
i gave it a 9/10 .
otherwise it was beautifully told
are unlikeable and annoying ,
as otherwise i would not have wasted $ 16 buying it off ebay.take it from me -
avoid like 7 2 offsuit ! ! !
- quickly became schoolhouse favorite ,
which never made them seem dull or boring .
the stark but unimaginative lighting and photography stems from the fagged out noir cycle .
every cloud has a silver lining and both scene show of her fantastic knocker
before uttering the immortal line `` ugh - there is an awful face in my soup '' .
therefore mal\u00e9fique is a great flick ,
what is worse ,
but the city he took a vacation was worse ,
which are best known for the sunglass
thought + secret plan + fun + black humor + sex !
( needed for the unlimited funeral ! )
when it finishes i miss it.. one of my favorite all time classic ...
it is not necessarily awful \u0096
and the character are too unsympathetic for `` incubus ''
there are quite a few tedious part
`` incubus '' was a bit of a disappointment ,
but whose work here lacks a measure of pzazz .
and some of the piece are actually funny ,
this film came highly recommended to me ,
this is now one of my favorite movie .
it was incredible
i loved this movie for two reason :
1 ) jeff combs is absolutely wonderful in it .
was not too badly done ,
not that i expect a great deal of plausibility in movie ,
cutting out all the pointless scene and all the profanity .
what an awful movie .
but i could not watch even half of the terrible acting
there is nothing redeeming about this movie .
the character come from either an endless supply of suicidally stupid cannon fodder or else
even the cgi is horrible .
this is truly one of the worst film ever made .
not the worst movie ever made ,
it is a wonderful portrayal of the cheerful side of georgian character .
necessary and perfect .
when we are obsessed with utter perfection .
nor will progress improve upon its greatness .
-- certainly much more than the classic 1953 version by george pal.it greatest fault is that it was obviously made on a very cheap budget .
this is particularly annoying during most of the interior shot ,
is very disappointing .
it is a great shame
not bad
it look much worse on a big screen .
you are easily put off by cheap production value ,
jeff wayne is making an animated film of his best-selling album from 1978 ,
bonnie bedelia was rather forgettable
that `` anchor aweigh '' is a great comedy .
gene kelly and frank sinatra make such a funny team !
and it did that wonderfully in an unforgettable dance number .
undoubtedly one of kelly 's funniest movie .
the direction is pathetically dilettante -
the so-called `` director '' is unable to build up at least a mediocre mise-en-scene ,
it would be ridiculous to mention concept as `` cinematographic language ''
that squanders the country 's money on such ridiculously scaous non-art
portrayed perfectly by nick nolte .
this is probably one of the worst `` wan na be a low budget
the film is so predictable
the special effect are so poor
it is technically good and i gave it 4/10 ,
on jeremy london 's part was horrible !
along with a good solid performance from the lead actor .
unfortunately
it has great potential
but get disappointed from the start .
i would not waste my time
pandora 's clock is among the best thriller
and this is one of the best thriller
the cast is great and slips into character from the novel so well
jane leeve is great her role as an ambassador 's assistant in a role
daphne zuniga is great as dr. sander
its presented making this the best airplane set movie since the original airport movie .
set are great
so one can pass this off as cheap exploitation horror ,
the great cast
beyond the excellent direction
acting and the predictable drama lies an essential message in the script : ''
`` evening '' has one of the best feminine cast i have ever seen in a movie
the resemblance of the stunning mamie gummer with her mother meryl streep is amazing
unfortunately the plot is confused
and i have not clearly understood the message of this film .
they were not able to make sense and fulfillment to the beautiful love story .
( at ridiculous price )
and it is beautifully crafted lesson in tolerance .
why just yesterday i burned down a church and i wrote `` for sam and arthur '' in its smoldering ashes.the cinematography was the best thing about this film .
unfortunately
smith does a great job portraying a man
if you can get past the ridiculousness of the whole thing
the acting is awful
but the movie is not a complete waste of time .
you could certainly do worse with an hour and a half of your time ,
it was awful ,
though given the ridiculous story and the nature of the character ,
an annoying dufus
the creepy next door neighbor with the bad rug
that was so bad
it was just plain awful .
to get rid of all the bad
not to mention poor special effect
and really bad writing all around
-- it was not even funny --
turning likable winkler into an obnoxious goof-off probably sounded like an interesting idea at the time
as henry 's beloved
uma thurman is great as the bipolar superhero
that luke wilson can be absolutely perfect
he is given two of the best comic performance of 2006
it is one of the funniest sex scene ever .
that the wonderful alan ball had anything to do with this mess .
is just awful .
the other actor do their best but with the clich\u00e9 character with difficult to perform accent
it is like nail on a chalkboard bad .
almost as awful is nelsan ellis ,
seem a bit over the top and pointless.about the only nice thing
hbo has had a string of bad luck with their show lately ,
horrible waste of time - bad acting
this is the most boring movie ever !
there are bad movie
that are fun
and there are bad movie
that are horrible .
recipe for one of the worst movie of all time :
has terrible aim with a gun
a lame attempt at a surprise ending and lot
avoid at all cost .
as bad as the movie was ... i
totally enjoyed it ,
it is the best of the best
i feel bad
the funny thing is ,
that is so lame ,
-good fun .
i gave it a '1 ' and an overall rating of 'awful ' for awful-good b ' movie .
ella was excellent ,
i will avoid naming the murderer
because of the plot `` thriller '' demands.a very well-done but dated film noire
done in the familiar short-scene tableaux format of the period.8/10 .
and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face
caro diario was funny
and a half is a high-pitched whine going on about how his politic are best ,
that is not completely dominated by his annoying voice .
it is fun ,
and you could conceivably enjoy this movie.this film is so stupid
is pointless .
even the title song is sung with pained enthusiasm.april love belong in the worst film bargain bin along with ishtar and plan 9 from outer space .
very very bad film
i still remember that kick ass fun song `` america 's funniest person . ''
frankly it should have been titled american 's lame or unfunny or downright disgusting person .
because of the lame crappy video person submitted .
also it developed as somewhat of a variety show with lame guest star
the video were disgusting and lame ?
garfield et al the best
is perfectly matched by the crummy production value .
using really really bad back projection .
how bad is it ?
it is just terrible .
avoid it .
to start a millennium with such nonsensethe film seems to suit 70 's but looks like an unintentional comedy for 2000anywayz some classic gem from the film :
he goes searching his mother in the village worst part is
who has the worst wigdirection
is badanil try hard looks too old in the younger role and too young in the older role yet good effort rekha is adequate ,
raveena too is okay harish is bad shakti kapoor is terrible aruna irani is as usual rajnikant is okay in a cameo
`` perfect alibi '' is an entertaining and very likable mystery thriller .
kathleen quinlan is excellent as alex mcarthur 's tormented wife and the character role ,
all the bare chested woman in the world could not keep me from hitting the stop button about a third of the way through this awful rubbish .
equally terrible script plus the poor cgi fx to match ;
this movie is an insult to the werewolf genre .
which in itself would be funny
of being a bad joke.this
avoid at all cost
this movie fails on many level ,
the cast is solid ; however
'' this is predictable ,
they are poorly written novel
based on bad theology.as a southern baptist minister
fundamentalist stance with regard to bible interpretation ,
but to state that the fundamentalist point of view is the only valid way
end-time prophecy is tenuous at best.but the real issue with these book is comes in the way
eddie murphy delirious is undoubtedly the funniest thing
there is not one dull spot in this piece of genius unlike eddie murphy raw
i gave this a 10/10
but after watching it i was really disappointed .
the best bit was
it was not going to be great .
but what i witnessed was to awful for word .
its just the movie was terrible .
overall it had bad ,
i mean awful special effect ,
the acting was not too bad ,
in my opinion the best sasquatch movie is harry and the henderson .
but it has the best depiction of sasquatch .
everything about them was great
everything.i loved the crab scene and the cooking scene.but
( no movie should ever be boring ,
excluding a disappointing ending ,
the director firstly presents the material in an extremely `` arrogant '' way and worse
and all we are left with is a mess of event
if you want to watch some boring person talk in a profound way about nothing
listened to some really bad actor going on about a woman and a horse ,
that is one great thing .
9-9,5/10 .
thing go bad - reaaaal bad -
'polouse story ' is one of the greatest action movie ever ,
and ends with one of the most incredible action sequence ever filmed .
everything in between is great .
the bad news for anyone
i purchased this video quite cheaply ex-rental ,
but this was just bland bland bland .
incredibly dull scene were oken up too sparsely by good wholesome cheap porn and entertaining dream horror sequence .
if ten of million of dollar can go into the countless bad film
will not be disappointed .
the song are superb
the actor are visually compelling especially karisma kapoor
who is surely one of the most beautiful actress anywhere in the film world .
who ought back the dead person..omg its so stupid i am
not even going to say any more about it.the last one was the best .
that a heart donor with the same rare blood type is found .
he is doing through an annoying voice-over
none of which are too fascinating .
that the director/writer is trying to make fun of the patient
maybe there is some dumb fun
what an incredible range turturro has as an actor ,
emily watson is excellent
i rate this one 9/10 .
this movie goes beyond just being bad ,
it is definitively the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life .
aside from incredible cinematography ,
it was a typical disney disappointment for me .
that jame earl jone narration is getting a bit boring .
i absolutely loved it .
the scariest `` bad guy
rachel mcadams was great .
the amazing part is that the end was not anti-climatic .
i was not disappointed in the end .
that he was the best columbo murderer in the series.peter falk is wonderfully understated in his role as columbo and the character 's inherent trait and oddity ,
spieberg 's effort should not be underestimated.unfortunately
without another murder.the climax is the most disappointing aspect of this episode .
cassidy 's character 's hitherto smugness and arrogance is amazingly expelled by a clue
the best actor in this movie .
so perfectly .
the greatest film actor in the history of the medium .
this is one of jimmy stewart best movie ,
most enjoyable romantic comedy
i greatly recommend this movie
and saw the worst film of my life .
it was so bad ,
i have yet to see anything else that bad since .
this movie is one of the best in-depth look at the life of a chess grandmaster ,
is a total waste of film ,
'' `` beautiful
unless these man were supposed to come off as the dumbest most ignorant proto-human
not a bad effort .
7/10 .
even the worst hypocrite of them all
and the flame leaped up right on her .
but surprisingly good acting .
so awful the image are .
how poor this film is .
the poor little girl is going to turn around
did we just waste our time watching ! ''
it is refreshing to go to a movie
i loved mindy sterling as the mother .
( more fun than the audience ) ,
acting stupid etc etc .
dorie barton is dreadful
and he is terrible .
is kind of funny
dull
stupid
i was delighted to finally see the release of amazing story the first season on dvd .
and you will not be disappointed with your purchase .
as unfortunately i do not seem to be able to rent it in the video store ,
i was disappointed
was one of the best teen-oriented film
as a prequel this is fairly lame .
absolutely putrid slasher film has not one redeeming quality .
( pamela anderson..awful as the killer ;
when she wastes person
we run the gamut of boring
and is merely a waste of time .
that will soon be recognized as the `worst film of all time ' by the `worst director of all time ? '
because it is `so bad
seems both pointless and part of band-wagon syndrome
we 'd cite.the film 's universal poor quality goes
without saying -- 'sixteen year of alcohol ' is not without competition for title of worst film
unfortunately
those moment of glory are so far buried in the shadow of this film 's poorness
'sixteen year of alcohol ' failed to entertain me even on a `make fun of the bad movie ' level .
not just bad ,
but obnoxiously bad as though jobson intentionally tried to make this film a poetical yawn
making it not profound but funny .
so bad it is good ?
and nothing more.definitely a film to watch with a group of bad-movie connoisseur .
so bad it is mike myer commentating in his cod scottish accent on it
jane eyre is a complex story of great richness
timothy dalton 's rochester is probably the best ever .
and this is fulfilled to perfection .
that this version with timothy dalton and zelah clark is the best !
this version has an excellent cast -
and is an amazing actor .
washington as always puts on a great performance.the plot in a nutshell :
and everyone puts in a great performance
and the directing is great .
the style of direction was something i enjoyed
and ought the best out of mexico citythis is one of those film
you will not be disappointed
the plot is very stupid
slacker is just a predictable teen flick
but there is no real true funny or original moment in the movie .
and some are actually pretty funny .
but they do a rather poor job in this film .
the funniest character was probably laura prepon though ,
slacker is not the worst film of 2002
rating 4.3/10 a below average teen comedy
the direction is bland and strangest of all ,
the fund would have also seen a more enlightened purpose fueling a crack-addict ;
and the film lacks a depth in term of character development
and not funny at all.the scene with regard to the 4 master of jay chou coming back
degenerated into a pointless plot
worse of all ,
all thank to jay chou 's excellent kung fu skill .
this is a great movie choice .
who just want to watch a great family film ,
this is a god-awful movie .
is horrible
the acting worse .
like all of those awful mario lanza movie ...
so as awful
the beautiful voice and memory are enough
it is corny and awful .
boring ,
badly written italian exploitation flick.lot of nudity ,
gore and awful acting.the werewolf makeup was the only thing
that would raise a laugh.complete rubbish-even for fan of cheesy italian horror.please avoid .
and that you most make the best out of every moment
all will be god damn perfect
which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audience.i would give
the hill have eye ii 4/10 for pure entertainment ,
and nothing else.4/10
into my personal best film ever collection.this film is loaded with humor
the usual large amount of celeity cameos and some really enjoyable song
as funny and smart and just plain illiant as this film was and is .
that this is possibly jackie chan 's worst movie
( memory is funny that way )
it is a basic good vs. bad chase movie with the final portion
'slick ' - very beautiful and organic and a tremendous amount of detail in the building
freddy has gone from scary to funny
and makes the series more funny than scary.so this film is really a comdey sore to speak.it is not the wrost in the series ,
but contains pervasive bad language
this is a great movie !
the acting and camera are excellent too
sadly
cinematography is excellent .
solid 9. torn and farrell excel in this movie .
poorlyacted
the acting is wooden and roeg 's attempt at his trademark dislocation of time are pitiful.avoid this one like the plague .
but conspicuously fails to walk the walk ,
the greatest performance would ever be zelda
it goes along with the movie wonderfully.9/10
the acting is terrible ,
it is so stupid
and some of the character are very annoying and whiny .
but not least the ending is terrible .
this movie was beautiful .
; it was designed for a quick glimpse at a few highlight of one of the most amazing american and historical religious figure of all time .
the worst movie i have ever seen .
it is not funny .
daniel day lewis in my left foot gives us one of the best performance ever by an actor .
as the younger christy brown and ray mcanally is great as the father .
was a bit on the predictable side ,
but this pathetic excuse for a film is just one of the most shameless bid at commercialization i have ever heard of .
ridiculous !
even terrible movie are not waste of time
this is actually a waste of time .
it should be avoided at all cost .
and sleazy at times.the acting is great
and intelligent movie with plenty of nudity and gore.you can not go wrong with it.8/10 .
a tacked-on ending is somewhat disappointing
of avoiding sentimantality .
this version is ridiculously politically correct .
the film lacks style ,
and mostly it lacks talent ,
tyne daly is not too bad .
it was utterly fantastic
despite this sometime tedious tendency ,
and was fun to watch .
fascinating ,
these moment occasionally appeared from among all of the great formula-driven schlock and gratuitous sex
so much fun to watch !
unfortunately suffering the blow of being condensed into a 96-minute movie .
the cgi animation is truly amazing in place ,
10/10 review
no matter how well meaning his `` message '' is - this film is a terribly made trainwreck -
awful acting
lame camera work - i do not know
he is lousy at it .
he is a bad actor -
predictable and sappy .
is one of the best part of the movie
the one bad point on the movie is the obvious cut between the actor talking ,
and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical
kris is so perfect for the film .
this was one of the best scene in the movie .
and they loved it to .
sadly ,
this was extremely poorly made .
sadly
without bruce he has a lame role in this movie .
will be disappointed to see
even the worst movie have at least one memorable bit .
this was a cheap way
other than the great cinematography by the marvelous jame wong howe in the battle scene ,
it was so lousy that i shut it off .
her battle message to the english troop is so lackluster in spirit.even a dashing laurence olivier can not save this utter piece of boredom.future wife vivien leigh is in a supporting role here
that history with the spanish armada is made out to be so boring in this film .
this movie is wonderful .
your heart makes is beautiful !
this movie is done so beautiful and smart !
but hey this is a great movie !
wood was terrific in this beautiful beautiful beautiful movie
a southern belle of a church goer has some bad experience
the best scene
getting photo of her in over-the-top pose and starring in ridiculous film of whip and chain and leather uniform .
it is the artistic study of film noir
but i would consider it a waste of your time .
just go waste your time on something a little less horrible and watch `` kazaam ''
has done a great job with this movie !
the dane character finally let 's buddy have the awful truth .
sadly .
and doody avoided the `` silly woman out of her depth in the wilderness '' portrayal most of us probably expected
it is amazingly better than richard chamberlain 's awful pair of quatermain flicks.it is very reminiscent of a western in many way .
this film is the single most terrible
but i have confidence this is worse .
as being within ten foot of it will probably give you a bad headache .
the plot was dull ,
but it just seemed to be filled with mediocre person .
there were literally no redeeming
excellent direction
highly recommended .
unfortunately
the film biggest weakness is it is unwillingness to commit to anything ;
chretien de troyes is spinning in his grave at this horrible adaptation
disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story .
that this is stupid ,
because it is getting worse.stuart arrife to his new home ,
jealousy from the elder `` other '' ,
boring and worn out as this is
but he only upgraded the clich\u00e9 from boring to abhorrent.then
and because of some funny gig ,
b. it had kept to the funny gig
and had left out boring clich\u00e9s
you 79 minute of your life.this is one of those cheap movie
this is just substandard junk.both priest and college student get a bad rap here .
and the college student come off even worse .
atlantis is probally the best disney movie
it has great action scene
that this year summer blockbuster season will be great.i recommend to you all
the lost empire is like a eath of inspiration.9/10
it was this stupid
the ending was wonderfully chosen
this film is the best living testament ,
as one of the best documentary film ever made.we must never forget .
but it is great fun ,
the original film could have been wonderful
their is also great work from tyne daly as mae and mark kudisch as conrad birdie
john hurt is great in this .
this is now one of my favorite comedy show .
david spade is funny ,
a very weak movie ,
but also poor acting in the case of robert downey jr.
when they arrive at her dilapidated shack in the poorer part of town ,
it is excruciatingly boring i would have rather sat through a seminar on creationism than have watched this if
it was going to be as boring
that this movie is `` unintentionally funny ''
not one thing is funny about this movie .
about stuff you would not understand nor care about and it is just as lame when the person start dying
but that should say something about how horrible it is .
worst movie ever.immediately after ejecting this filth from my dvd player i started scraping it against the cement in front of my house ,
how did such a terrible script manage
ridiculous
predictable and thoroughly unbelievable
but the material is so bad
it still qualifies as one of the all-time worst thriller i have seen in year .
avoid at all cost ,
i have never read a positive review of this sadly misunderstood drama about class division
( three theme most great romantic story or film have in common )
not exactly a time of great financial trouble in america
alone and unloved ,
beautiful score
great set design
the messy apt .
wonderful and heartfelt performance by the whole cast
the plot is not that great
bad special effect .
do deny it.so the acting is bad ,
boring and
score/music is ultraboring ,
its a dull combination of the thing
outeak and some jerry bruckheimer/michael bay production gone really really bad .
no one.though i have seen far worse ,
the movie is also dull
this bargain basement lousy-cgied movie was apparently a failed series pilot .
which is a stupid idea )
the great caruso displays the unique talent of mario lanza .
he shows great acting capacity
have wonderful child
dan katzir has produced a wonderful film
probably the dumbest ending of all time ,
( don messick and casey kasem are perfect as scooby and shaggy ) ,
however it is rather disappointing .
scrappy is somewhat more annoying than usual .
and the joke and the story line were in general lame and unoriginal ,
not as bad as shaggy and scooby doo :
but this show is disappointing .
4/10 for the animation
loved joan .
great performance .
great old movie drama .
beautiful woman ... .wealth ... .. greed ... ..murder ... .detective ... ... a trial ... ..the costume are very nice .
over all the drama is surprisingly addictive
plus the male cast are not bad on the eye too .
i give it a 9/10
so that to avoid incidence
is wonderful .
richard thomas play a bad guy .
you must see him here at his best being bad !
and i actually enjoyed it then .
the acting was awful ,
the acting was awful at best .
but the execution was just poor .
braveheart was even worse though ,
to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotype .
that downloading nancy becomes nothing more than an exercise in poor taste and soft pornography .
who was none other than australian kickboxing 's favorite son
ajax and theo get into all sort of ridiculous situation
it is all pretty ridiculous ,
too bad the movie relies heavily on split-second appearance by former celeity .
the funny thing was chopper just rapped for 30 second
this was not too bad ,
because this movie is just that damn bad .
spoiler this is a great film about a conure .
he learns a lot through his journey and meets up with a lot of other beautiful bird .
i had to see this gem twice to really appreciate all of it .
this is one of the best thriller
i give this film a 9/10 .
enjoyable from start to end it is both sad yet uplifting at the same time .
) and george del hoya are beautiful and yet almost painful to watch ,
which fails in pretty much every way
terrible script
lousy acting
laughable special effect ...
it is just an utterly awful movie .
so outrageously funny
while horrible ass banging and thudding sound are heard off screen .
there is an awful lot of comedy in this film
if this film is supposed to be so funny ,
i still had a lotta fun
that live feed is another pretty poor low budget shot on a camcorder type horror film
the script is pretty poor ,
the character 's were fairly poor clich\u00e9s
but it does look cheap
the editing is choppy and annoying ,
and the film has a cheap look about it .
the blood looks a little too watery for my liking and entire scene bathed in annoying neon light sometime makes it hard to tell what happening ,
it to often looks like it was shot on a hand-held camcorder and the choppy editing at least on the 'r ' rated version is at time an annoying mess .
the acting is poor ,
i did not think much of it with it is very weak predictable storyline lacking exposition
poor acting and less than impressive gore
just to have a very cheap laugh at the name `` woody '' but in truth
the script and dialogue is laughable .
the acting was awful ,
( imdb rating 3/10 )
it to be one of the worst slasher film out there .
this is by far not one of the worst out there ,
but not the worst nonetheless .
the night brings charlie is the worst .
just a bad one.the film was obviously intended not to be taken too seriously .
for a comedy it is amazingly bereft of even the slightest venture into the realms of humour - right up until the ridiculous `` twist '' ending ,
what an utter waste of time the whole movie actually is .
that you can stare at the screen in slack-jawed disbelief at how terrible it is .
it was a whole lotta fun .
sharon stone is great ,
even if her movie is horrible
i tip my hat to this movie8/10
or the philosophical message
you will waste your time .
and is still enjoyable by a large range of viewer ,
quickly switch gear with the a superb dysfunctional couple scene
blames thatcher for anything she can .
overall this show did not get the best viewing time
pulpy story and manage to create one of the undiscovered gem of 1950s cinema.richard widmark plays a petty thief tough guy
but more from a sense of indifference than bad writing or direction .
that are effectively dull and depressing to watch .
madison is not too bad-\u0097if you like simplistic
prepare to be disappointed.professional film critic have commented at length on the formulaic nature of the film and its penchant for utilizing every hackneyed sport clich\u00e9 in the book .
what i felt was sadly missing was any sense of the real excitement of unlimited hydro racing in the `` glory year ''
it was wonderful to see the old classic boat roaring down the course six aeast ,
in one particularly ridiculous shot ,
even he could not make this movie enjoyable .
my student never made anything this bad ...
it is like watching your great grandmother flirting with a 15 year old boy ...
how he tricked mclaglen into getting a really bad hangover for the trial scene .
the show became more about coping with the loss of a loved one ... i
losing a loved one ...
who provide great laugh ,
but the true gem is cj ...
is not a bad idea ; certainly ,
it lacks integrity .
which is not dumbing thing down with poor dialogue
and a weak plot ,
this universal/studio canal joint venture would not have such bad review .
that was out of place and annoying
and he tends to avoid direct confrontation with international rescue .
if there is a great lack of realism.this scene
that it is not nearly as stupid as some other scene of the movie .
that this is a `` hidden gem '' .
and it is not a gem .
the earlier part of the film was rather enjoyable
as a semi-autistic man was annoying .
it was the perfect symbol of 70s cultural overindulgence and self-absorption ;
there is even an excellent vh1 documentary about the club
to spawn a very captivating film.sadly ,
sometime it captures perfectly the shallowness of the nightlife culture
but a lot of it is due to the kid-gloved treatment
is hamstrung here by the shallowness and stupidity of his character ;
mary lambert does a great job
this is a good film and an excellent adaption .
non horror fan will want to avoid this .
i do not think about that wonderful tv series .
this was a surprisingly good early 40 's horror flick
with very surprisingly good sound and picture for a 67 year old public domain horror movie .
i actually enjoyed watching bela lugosi and his bizarre staff ,
i also enjoyed the plucky young female reporter ,
but still fun to watch .
even ridiculous and unbelievable for a movie .
the first two part of this saga of this transformation of michael corleone make for one of the greatest tragedy in cinematic history.then ,
he shows remorse for his previous action not through subtle behavior ,
this greatly corrupts the meaning of the first two films.the godfather part iii is a horrible mess of a film
i felt awful watching this documentary ,
you are our heroes.10/10
nothing is a fantastic film
the excellent character development
watch this wonderful family film
as it is perfect as-is .
some other viewer did not understand what is so beautiful and interesting in this movie .
of life.the art is beautiful
it is a great masterpiece .
this is arguably the worst film i
and i have quite an appetite for awful
which was really very funny .
that is so extremely bad
that was worse than this ,
no way.the acting is beyond bad
and all the line are lousy clich\u00e9s .
this may not be the very worst movie peter seller ever did
a major motion picture would portray asian so insultingly ... or
this film provides an eerie premonition of a great comic 's death
it is one of my favorite movie and i am not hindi at all
enjoyed it too so it surprises me
she is very beautiful and my favorite actress ever !
that is pretty ridiculous ,
as he has the bad taste
might be found in the bad old catholic church ,
worse still
sadly
best thing i ever did.the actor are beautifully suited to their character and ing them to delightful life
should this gem ever find its way to a dvd release ,
envy has great performance by two actor
there were a lot of great scene
-- all great stuff.i can not stand person
enjoyable gem.remember this person ;
i was amazed at how poor the whole thing was from start to finish .
its a bit lame not to stand by that view ,
this episode was beyond poor .
was poor .
the effect were dreadful-
it might have been better just to -not- show the monster at all rather than show the lame excuse for a monster
sitting through some really poor episode to find the good one .
a bland leading man .
and fails to show any basic start
this is a terrible production of bartleby
which is not as much fun
tedious and hilarious .
if an adaptation is handled poorly
this movie was very very mediocre and very very gory .
and totally forgot how to act i mean it was so bad
i loved this movie .
it has some of the greatest quote ever .
but it is still one of the greatest movie ever made .
sheryl lee is beautiful
he makes great job expressing the feeling from the book to the film .
this is certainly the worst movie i ever saw ?
the acting is somewhat not so bad..
the cast is perfectly selected
the one point i gave it.what made this movie an insult to the ain
and is certainly one of their best movie i have seen.a man
excellent.rating :
annoying
the plot lacks sophistication or credibility ,
the last episode was dull
dull
dull .
that this appallingly unfunny montage was not the acme of humour in the 70s or indeed in any other era !
it would still not get close to summing up just how mindless and drivel-ridden this waste of 75 minute is .
( and it could actually have been funny )
i missed ram laxman badly.it had no double entendre
everything was almost great .
that is why it lacks the emotional punch-the very purpose of this turn of event .
to transcend the movie from a beautiful pre-marital video to a 'feature film ' .
this was so lame
it was so weak ,
i do not really blame the actor ,
those line were intended to be funny.it
aside from the first boring twenty minute
but these are probably among the worst scene in the film ,
as they are badly executed .
the special effect are lousy
i somewhat enjoyed this film .
it definitely has a `` so bad
once i got past the ridiculously clich\u00e9d plot ,
terrible acting
particularly because the film is not that great to begin with and the ending makes the entire film pointless.bottom line ,
though not a complete waste
this film is pretty bad and not remotely scary.my grade :
and previous screenplay adaptation were great ,
listening to a speech impaired 90 year old drunk duck hunter with a right cranial lobe dysfunction
this movie is so horrible
which is such a positive message
and was excellent for the role .
sadly
and even enjoyed him in dude where is my car ? .
but the mtv movie award were simply horrible .
last year 's performance by jack black and sarah michelle gellar was extremly funny
kate and luke just went into their lame dialogue ,
and seann was completly wasted as a talent ,
( like in your best actor academy award speech )
simply because of the speech by gollam for best visual performance .
this one is in a battle with some of the most awful movie of all time .
sometimes movie are bad in a way
this was so bad i got angry .
what a waste .
looking for a fun movie .
her heroine is devastatingly beautiful ,
i regularly trail through dull short film
that has a simple and enlightened message ,
not to mention ridiculous amount of violence and disaster sequence
coupled with idiotic dialog and a lot of horrible acting .
is forced to endure a mounting body count and ridiculous amount of violent shoot em-ups plus earthquake disaster scene .
i mean these conspiracy movie are mostly drowning in the character pool of noir hero .
to build a movie about such un-visual bases.the next man is a perfect example of its time :
in fact you can tell how much it will be bad from the very first sequence piling up 'watcha that ' murder
directing at its worst
do not waste your time - otherwise ,
i loved the stewart granger/deborah kerr version - i have seen it dozens of time ,
and the supporting cast is superb .
and the score is perfect .
you will not be disappointed .
lee manage to get stabbed to death and fails
the narrator was annoying .
the `` special effect '' were laughable .
this is extremely poorly observed .
ealing made many great movie .
funny
its not funny
this was stupid funny movie.. cheech
and chong are the dopiest wasted guy ever ... i rate this film a 7..
there funnier and crazier .
has quite a bad rep and i knew
( the gracefully-aged star has pathetically asserted a number of time in interview
is not only terrible ,
of the film is the pointless elliptical editing \u0096
and the cheapjack special-effect at the climax !
in devising a stupid subtitle with a dual meaning !
the actor were incredible ,
but the writing was poor
if you do not watch this movie.3/10
there are usually some pretty funny comic
not because they are funny ,
tedious
boring
is the worst example of the kind of pretentious heavy handed art school dreck
you can not take your eye off of it until the ridiculous and absurd end .
`` logan '' is a really annoying iconoclast film maker
and having what seem like really bad orgy .
either from his hamfisted overacting or the incredible awfulness of his painting .
all of course terrible nude of susanne .
its incredibly stupid .
and enjoyed it .
it did not really even come close to describing how bad thing actually were .
there are great scene with crispen glover
that it is indeed one of the worst movie of all time .
the film 's average rating is 1.9/10 .
best/worst gift ever ?
the camera angle were horrible .
the acting was terrible and i could not even bear to watch it.dennis raider never had long hair .
if you want a badly shot half-porno with some slaughter scene
the character are all wonderful person ,
the story lacks any tension
this is john water best film to date .
i enjoyed the film
i was impressed by the beautiful photography in this film ,
but even these were fascinating .
but they were excellent in their role
this is a perfect series for family viewing .
the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with a john william 's feel
this is a gem to be enjoyed by all .
not have portray the role of a bad `` guy '' .
so refreshing and educating .
segment was the best ,
this movie was one of the worst i
just terrible.in its most generous light ,
why other character in this movie found anything redeeming in her -
this is one of the worst film i
is it was so bad
no where near as fun as any of romero 's work ,
and the way the person die is so stupid .
definitely the worst film i have seen in year .
the story was bad .
the acting was bad .
the always wonderful sissy spacek did nothing to make this movie better .
why did i waste my time and money on something
that i suspected would be bad ?
and therefore can not avoid what otherwise should be avoided .
i will not waste your time
do not waste your time ,
it is just stupid.my friend
but i can not say.at least this film had a redeeming quality :
`` this scene was redeeming ,
flawed but honest with a terrible honesty .
and they can still sing and play at a high level as this wonderful dvd concert disc shows us .
in shape and his drum playing was solid .
but his voice is great
this is just excellent material and performing from guy
the highlight of the concert for me.highly recommended .
and everyone is quite funny .
this movie is the best film ever .
excellent dialogue
xu zhu was excellent as the king of mask .
here is a rare gem for those of you
all of which unfortunately bombed .
some great fireball throwing in this flick ... eat your heart out ,
yet funny element
but turned out the worst .
was pretty damn bad
more and more death occur.what is funny is
'' the more `` best buds '' vanish
you will have to rewind 3-4x to actually get the laughable and incoherent motive
it is a horrible and illogical first draft script \u0096 please ,
i loved horror film .
this awful movie did not wound me as a child .
the chesty irish priest was as lame as the love interest .
it is like a tedious exercise by someone
perfect metaphor for this film really .
the photography of skye is beautiful though
is another film about fairy story filmed in skye and beautifully photographed -
this should be a far more enjoyable film
- the entire event is dully paced
has no chemistry asides from being unintentionally funny due to poor production .
best skip this and watch the two original .
because it is bad.it is almost painfully tedious and unbelievable ,
they had just make him obnoxious .
obnoxious jerk is dying ?
the matador is a funny and sometimes touching character study .
the writing is superb .
it looks cheap ,
it is a terrible story
and it is executed bad in every possible way .
it is so bad
it is funny .
i just found it an incredible waste of time and money .
not an altogether bad start for the program
the worst part of the series is that it attempts to bill itself as reality fare
poor editing
not great ,
but also not that bad either .
was catwomanly bad ,
i could not let my pun go to waste
and trying to avoid hearing the result .
solid entertainment
so i officially declare my plight greater than yours.the gist fan of jimmy fallon ,
but it will make a great matin\u00e9e.rating :
the best part is the swing number
the humor in who 's your daddy is such poor taste
close up of seman are not funny !
john thaw is a an excellent actor .
the film is also excellent .
this movie really does great job
but this was still a great flick to watch .
and acting is great.one of the best movie
annoyingly overacted
and did not find it nearly as annoying .
for the worst movie of all time.seven friend
if you have absolutely no regard for your loved one
10/10 .
you can call it awful
acted even worse and the direction
the special effect are funny
from the tribute i can assume it to be as bad .
should have given it 1/10 ,
the final pairing of nelson eddy and jeanette macdonald is basically a complete misfire.the script is weak
and has been presented badly.the film just has no life in it.eddy and macdonald would have been better off
but it was still enjoyable .
the best thing about this movie is the music
and dull.but the worst thing
or the lame direction
after staring at kristofferson 's and streisand 's awful 70 's hairdos for 2+ hour ,
noir .
otto preminger 's follow-up to `` laura '' is a film noir
dixon try to pin the blame on crime boss tommy scalese .
the beautiful morgan taylor .
it is also wonderfully paced
it lacks the verbal wit of wilder
of what a noir should be ,
is likewise disappointing .
but the set design fails to reinforce it .
rather than toy with the possibility of where noir can go .
but lacks that extra special magic .
as opposed to just concentrating on pointless action and special effect .
`` dick tracy '' is one of the best and most overlooked of the comic book movie genre .
infinitely better in piece action comedy is a real mess as a whole .
a movie best summed up by the scene
by pulling some poor animal 's intestine out from under her t-shirt .
too terrible for word .
this movie is quite possibly one of the most horrible horror flick i have seen .
the foster parent died was just plain ridiculous .
but the directing is very poor .
basinger is weak -
i was not even disappointed ,
it lacks some really good actor of its era.it reminds me of a bad xerox copy of wonderful photograph.this is a complete waste of your time .
that it was a lot of fun .
it was a great experience .
i loved the writing and acting
the movie does a great job
it was the greatest movie ever .
how much fun it is !
so much fun ,
that the storyline of dtr is not near to the greatness of max payne ,
is the story ridiculous ?
and unfortunately the script does not give us an adequate reason
because it was the best story
by the entire cast is excellent
always fantastic ,
and it made me feel terrible about the choice .
what great movie should be .
the movie music has selection from one of the best living composer :
after watching this movie i was honestly disappointed -
story or directing - i was disappointed by this film advertisements.the trailer
and i bought the movie.the disappointment started
but even thought i found this movie really unchallenging and even a little bit boring .
this is a beautiful
sometimes quite subtle
the film also examines the good and bad of traditional chinese culture ,
that the ending weakens the film ,
after the best movie of fred olen ray 's career
but not nearly as fun as i had with it .
it was that bad .
i have seen much worse
but i have seen worse in my day .
4/10 .
and to make it worse ,
but he was annoying in this movie .
the storyline was stupid .
i am usually not this judgemental of movie ,
i laugh at anything stupid usually .
best of all
that the acting suck but it are not that bad
7.5/10
why the jury took such a bad decision ,
but this one is excellent but not gay .
that this is one of the worst movie
at least `` plan 9 '' was enjoyable.i did really enjoy `` christine ''
.but this mess was a total mistake in every way possible .
the great opera singer should stick to singing ... ..not
that he is a terrible actor .
but after that it is nothing but a boring soap opera.appropriately
i momentarily paused on cheap seat
shoulder-shrugging bad .
but i have to give these moronic and boring twin credit
no one will now how awful it is and he/she can keep the $ 425,000 annual salary.you
this has got to be one of my very favorite twilight zone episode
it is an excellent one -
kinda fun
badly ...
almost annoying - definitely not faithful to the original character ...
as best i can tell ,
i loved cooper his insight through out
he was by far my favorite character .
it was a great show i
my favorite number in the film however is tra-la-la
an american in paris was chosen best picture for 1951 ,
as well.still an american in paris is one of the best movie musical ever
and involve you more and more into the story.the actor are great -
michelle pfeiffer is the perfect witch ,
and claire dane a wonderful choice for the innocent and loving 'star '
everyone is trying to give his best for this movie .
unforgettablefor me this is the number one entertaining movie of 2007 ,
watch it and enjoy it11/10 - outstandingpeace
william is a great actor
i found guy kibbee not quite right as the lame-ained candidate
is bad for rock n ' roll
because it reminded me of one of my favorite 80s film
this movie is poor .
that they waste the time
a definite 1/10
in this movie the performance of some of the actor is horrible
don\u00b4t waste your time !
the simple is the best ! i have learned something more about life from this movie
but the time u are together is really unforgettable .
as grateful and nice memory ... this movie might be cheap in the making price
but its meaning are totally not cheap .
i rarely can learn anything from movie ,
taylor has a great scene
the side story were completely ridiculous
the visual and the score were very beautiful
that we grew up watching lot of good cop/bad cop hindi film
as best hindi feature film
and best actor- om puri and 3 filmfare award in best film
best director and best supporting actor category .
recommended to all who are interested in nostalgia of serious hindi film.ratings- 8/10
the acting is uniformly poor
and do not even get me started on that terrible 'twist ' ending .
this film comes off like a poorly written
but it fails at every turn due to a lack of talent
it was the best sniper rifle ever made .
any information would be great .
even worse
the worst script imaginable
but i certainly expect the last 30 min or so to not exactly enhance the already pathetic attempt in cinema ... thank god we have got a good looking lead to somewhat make us forget
i enjoyed the story by itself ,
govinda was excellent in the role of the cab driver
and how they eventually fall in love would have made it a much more enjoyable film.the
when it comes to comedy.juhi chawla and anil kapoor
were wasted needlessly .
anil kapoor would have got himself shot much
if jean renoir 's first film `` whirlpool of fate '' first takes us into the world of the countryside
making full use of the amazingly huge apartment and backstage area
and the acting though frequently overwrought offers some great moment as well
-- this and other gleaning of the ridiculousness of the idle rich help give the film the depth it has.far from his greatest achievement ,
seeing for renoir fan or those
in a rare feature of early seventy horror the technicality of the movie are virtually flawless
that dripped blood ' are the somewhat asinine plot-twist at the end of the first two segment and the predictable ending of the picture ,
he discovers a wax model of a beautiful woman
in this segment the viewer is given no more than very subtle clue as to the mystery of the wax woman
and while this is quite possibly the weakest of the four story ,
the greatest of the four segment \u0096 \u0091sweet to the sweet ' .
this is the best example
that made the entire film great .
and i would give this segment a rare 10/10.the film is ended with the story
he begin to fear the worst .
to wrap up a wonderful anthology .
what makes the story so enjoyable .
unfortunately
that could be classed as frightening in any sense and the predictable ending could have been executed better
but nonetheless the segment has its redeeming feature .
that dripped blood ' is one of the greatest horror anthology
that feature an incredible cast
great story and above par direction .
there are certainly worse way to spend one hundred minute of your life
and while blood and gut fan will be highly disappointed ,
that dripped blood ' \u0096 8/10 .
which is still a really great idea ,
but this movie 's actor are worst then ben 's performance in pearl harbor ,
the plot and script are also horrible ,
the poor attempt to frighten you
are worse then one used in 80 's sitcom show and in the end
is not the least bit enjoyable .
this movie is a lot of fun .
what makes it great especially are two thing :
some with high expectation may have been disappointed ,
but this movie is a lot of fun
it was so bad at time
which made it a fun watch.if
you are looking for a low-grade slasher movie with a twist of psychological horror and a dash of campy ridiculousness ,
that the sound is very bad .
yes there are great performance here .
unfortunately
( bad )
that i wasted two hour of it watching this film .
that it would be as terrible
that this misplaced gem of the disco era was glory bound for the dumpster.the first foretelling of just how bad thing were to be was the narration at the beginning ,
from the opening scene with the poorly-done effect to the `` monster '' from another world and then the house
really bad .
dreck about three beautiful woman in california
boring
pointless
utterly stupid `` horror '' film .
bach and her two buddy are certainly beautiful
but the movie itself is dull dull dull !
the final `` revelation '' is laughably predictable
boring
pointless and unknown
( which i hear has not received a great adaptation to the screen ) .
that were provoked from me were of the time wasted
as a platform for their political view - usually a very boring movie
fun
then you will like this little gem .
-- and that is not a bad thing .
but i loved it .
this director ings together a wonderful cast of everyday person
and gets a great ensemble-type performance .
a great film nevertheless .
that the girl is a lousy actor- i honestly do not .
she is given poor line .
when i sat down to watch this film.the movie was not that terrible ... initially .
to fight `` the great evil '' and save the world ?
the great evil comes out of wendy 's rival-for-homecoming 's body ,
article out.now ... it was bad enough
the worst part
this movie has a lot of bad ,
but something funny happens
( if you want to watch a great `` war '' movie )
that plain stupid !
this movie was god awful .
it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snake .
do not waste your time or money on this piece of over hyped trash .
that is funny and entertaining ,
there is something about mary was funny so
solid entertainment just look at his reviews.anyway see
it would be fun
it is fun to see jeffrey hunter
not just a great `` mystery '' episode ,
i am afraid the second season lacks the charm ,
the writing lacks the intelligence and comedic hint
unfortunately pp is not so .
he is one of my favorite actor
the script was so bad .
there was also a really annoying bloke at the beginning of the film
it was funny to watch
that humanity may utilize technology.brilliant for it is time ,
this film is amazing -
will find this fantastic .
nuit noire contains almost no plot .
if the film had a really fascinating plot full of tension with a captivating denouement ,
i would give it a 10/10 .
i gave the movie an 8. nuit noire is a film worth watching .
alien and the quest for immortality.the woman are beautiful and the photography stunning .
its a laughable mess .
great to look at but as any semblance of a horror film or thriller purely awful .
and feature again two beautiful actress
featured in mulholland dr.beautiful .
that has had great influence not only on the buddy genre but action genre as well .
to a young boy this was a great film .
too late to lament lost innocence.hopefully this film will not be forgotten and a few
amazingly
and bug is trying to fly their saucer back to earth.i really enjoyed this
although the ending is a little weak
called the film pathetic
she portrayed maya pre and post assault with great ease
and the transition between the two is an act i rarely ever see done well .
that way.parker posey makes an amazing mary .
that so many great character-actor would actually be in this !
the cast is great ,
highly recommended to all action-lover !
then see that there are no attempt at cheap humor
is funny !
was the best part of the show.i have alway preferred kerry to bridget ,
were fun
without the hennessey dad.bridget seemed to get more annoying ,
which before seemed funnier
the granddad is funny
( especially when he is watching great escape )
he is funny in part
over all the newer one are not bad just missing excitement
but later one were about average at best .
it was some of the best tv drama
so i eagerly anticipated `` caprica '' and i was not disappointed.i was hoping
eric stolz and esai morale give solid performance ,
and alessandra was just wonderful .
thinking if not good it might be at least a bit dazzling and fun.wrong !
was charlie 's angel really that boring ?
as bad as movie of this type can be ,
but it was very bland ,
that is pretty much it.not awful .
not the worst of tv movie .
since unfortunately you are not black ,
and a great episode of justice .
-- -and a wonderful beginning of superman.in this episode
mayeda must battle all odd to survive and the secure the fate of his beloved japan . ''
awesome.the greatest thing about this movie is sho kosugi 's engrish accent .
awesome.2/10 - so very very cheesy .
since the little mermaid was one of my favorite disney movie
it is not funny ,
it is great for little one ,
this movie is fun for kid ,
so we should let them have fun .
lacks empathy and depth :
is a terrible decision :
that the best sequence in the show
is cut drastically to make way for a terrible new song
cassie 's `` mirror dance '' has a new song and tragically boring choreography
they were going to mess with a working formula this much.for fan of musical theatre and those
who enjoyed the stage version ,
this movie is a sad mockery of everything they cherished and loved .
this movie is plain fun.i has nothing to do with the original america pie ,
but it is fun to watch.another try
and we had fun.you will not find any deep message in this movie ,
a laugh-track and boring humour.if you do not wish to look at the rest of this review
not only because it is unfunny
friend is as much to blame for reality tv
of having perfect character :
is almost certainly the opposite of funny .
the humour is boring .
there is no way to make a perfect character
that one or more of the central character does something stupid at some stage during the proceedings ,
extremely poor sound and no discernible plot/narrative ,
but it is great entertainment .
the action takes us from an indian raid on a cabin ; one of the best part of the movie with jean arthur excellent
the whole thing is ridiculous but great fun and entertaining from start to finish .
jean arthur is one of the best actress of this era
i have already seen him two other time and loved him every time
because he was so funny and a eath of fresh air .
this film also is great to watch
there are many other wonderful character actor along for the ride
they sure made the job easier for leading man and woman edmund lowe and virginia bruce.these great character actor are one of the big reason
while the mystery itself is rarely that terrific ,
vance is played wonderfully by lowe but ,
unfortunately
while not the best philo vance film ,
i have never seen a movie as bad as this .
it is meant to be a `` fun '' movie ,
and it is not funny .
it is patently awful ! !
( that is how forgettable this is )
a powerfully wonderful movie .
this would be an excellent picture .
quite the most boring nonsense i have seen in a long time .
and the acting was the worst i have seen in a long time.to make it worse ,
the incidental music was terrible
unfortunately
too bad this project did not get the necessary talent
when you come across a gem of a movie like this ,
it is definitely one great movie .
the bad thing is ,
every episode i have sat through was like a lame
talking about something boring ,
the character are all forgettable one dimensional cutout ,
trying to be funny ,
it is just sad.the movie was terrible as well .
it was great !
unlike the great new `` battlestar galactica '' series
`` stargate '' copied the look and feel of the lame movie too closely !
cafe lumiere is a beautifully photographed nullity .
( a perfect blank page ) .
at their faces.there was a great spanish film by bardem
that would be a far better title to this pointless exercise .
the acting in this movie was superb .
a favorite actress of mine
it was an amazingly cheap movie
because at the least ending of this dreadful piece of mostly incoherent film-making
funny
even if only in its subtlety .
imagine how great the film could have been though
and i have enjoyed it every time .
but back in the 70 's it was great .
it was wonderful .
santa claus was amazing
it is a fun movie to watch .
it teaches child good vs. bad .
but the spanish is the best .
but it is a funny gag .
sadly it is a wasted opportunity .
that separate the good film from the illiant.elvira herself is always fun and engaging .
just do not expect too much.she is more than just a great set of boobs .
she is also an incredible pair of leg .
the character are all enjoyable ,
and the film did not leave me disappointed .
she and i both really enjoyed the film
`` my summer story '' is basically a mishmash of mediocre
kiernan culkin is a poor substitute for ralphie ,
it is a very poor one and not worth most person 's time .
2/10 .
that can ruin even the best accusation case
and that can nourish the worst deepest imaginable thirst for vengeance .
is just as bad as to let circumstantial elemant ruin the work of the police or of justice .
the best intention on the police side are ruined by some personal involvemant and vengeful intention ,
and here the film show vengeance is the worst possible motivation in the rendition of justice and in the establishmant of public peace .
or you hate adam sandler or don cheadle.an excellent cast ,
then he did a couple bad movie ,
one of the best movie of 2007 .
i could go buy a cheap synthesizer
i wasted $ 4 renting this ,
jame stewart is excellent
this movie fails to do so.there is no sense
and they become nothing more than simple puppet serving the purpose of a very light narrative.the pacing of the movie can become annoying
which unfortunately often sounds mismatched.i can not believe
this a poor attempt at it .
but it is a bad one
clich\u00e9d and stupid.. and joyless
and insulting clockwork orange ripoff .
this is not the worst film i have ever seen ,
and looks quite grainy and bad .
i found it to be fairly boring and predictable
3/10 .
but voodoo academy still stands as the absolute worst film i have been able to track down .
no doubt the really bad one are not even available to buy or watch on tv ,
most of those stand head and shoulder above this ... excersize in absolute monotony.i like to rate truly bad film
it is not that bad .
it is bad but could be a lot worse.it took 5 of us
and not even the usually fun moment of watching bad film
and was an utter gem .
it is not an excuse for how bad this baby is.spoilers ahead ...
but not overly amatuer ... i have seen a lot worse in better film ...
but somehow it is the semi competent delivery of some of the worst line you will ever hear in a film ,
you have a fascination with the worst of the worst ,
there is worse ...
highly enjoyable
and beautiful .
and some solid sentiment and humour as well .
stardust is a fun film
and has some fun performance from the like of claire dane as the star
playing the horrible witch to robert deniro
playing a nancy-boy air pirate to perfection .
( loved this whole thread as well ) .
peter o'toole play the dying killer daddy and watch for funny man ricky gervais
the mood of the film is captured perfectly by the camera-work
and ( lack of ) lighting.a great discourse .
sure it was funny at time .
even laugh out loud funny .
baby mama has some funny scene
and fails to have the heartwarming
mean girl is one of my favorite movie .
tina fey and amy poalher both did great in that
but this is not there best .
sigourney weaver and steve martin add to the cast greatness.another pregnancy movie has hit the cinema world .
after the great knocked up and juno ,
baby mama 's ending was unfunny and dull.baby mama was not the best comedy of the year
..4/10
and the pathetic joke had me cringing with shame for ever hiring
worth no more than 3 vote highly unrecommended for anyone not wanting to waste 2 hour of their life .
it is very bad ,
beowulf and the other dane seem like ridiculous viking
is so ridiculous ,
as well as the consequence of lying.the special effect are mighty terrible .
grendel and his mother hag are poorly conceived ,
making it a guilty pleasure at best .
great movie
have to say one of my favorite movie of all time .
which is great .
still a good 7/10 for me .
were just awful by today 's standard .
many of them bear a strong similarity to home movie featuring obnoxious relative mugging for the camera .
my assumption is that all movie at this time must have been pretty bad ,
and really annoying them .
i can not understand why and the short consist of charlie wandering about the park annoying these person and some other later in the film .
but the film lacks coherence and just is not particularly funny
a typical poor effort
the cinematography was pretty bad
that is very bad considering
that still haunts me is that dreadful song `` i wish
the best part of this movie though
and end up chum for swarming hammerhead shark ... ..cut to weak back story
this was surely the stupidest
as in the fascination watching a horrible car accident
with incredibly annoying performance from devon sawa and jason schwartzman
the joys of no-budget 50s sci-fi yet despite the odd gem like that
it is beyond cheap
and pretty dull with it ,
though it has a surprisingly altruistic message \u0096 the mute mole-man
great story and superb performance
but the message and concept this movie carries are absolutely superb .
( boring copy-cat )
could have been avoided
anu malik is worst musician around
i call this a perfect movie .
not one boring second
a fantastic cast of mostly little known actress and actor
a great array of character
perfect lighting
were pathetic at best .
please do not insult the intelligence of the viewer by inserting into the film scene
these element seemed like the cheap device
am rather fond of.1/10 .
i am disappointed .
but blew it on over editing and bad directing- .
but it is really a poor excuse for a sexploitation flick .
( subtle name )
where to begin criticizing a film this bad .
( at best )
the direction by joseph brutsman is horrible with bad lighting
uninspired framing and poor actor direction .
great to see you
and so poorly simulated
that her perfect husband is a lecherous animal .
if this movie were any worse ,
this nonsensical mess makes ed wood look like hitchcock .
sowed with salt and reserved as a landfill for the most toxic of waste .
and it is also great to see role for big george eastman and michael berryman.added to this ,
- this simply is a really fun and lighthearted take on the genre
paperhouse is perfect in every exquisite detail
it is so rare to find a film
imaginative cinematography and the most beautiful and haunting soundtrack you are ever likely to hear
that are best remembered
but there were a number of smaller but nevertheless excellent production ,
and both give excellent performance .
and it is a great performance from him also ;
the second half of the film is the best
the invisible ray may not be one of the very best horror film of the thirty ;
and comes recommended .
starts with some extremely dull shot of an american town somewhere
at first joe is visibly disappointed
the nostril picker is easily one of the worst film i
it is absolutely terrible in every possible way imaginable .
not only was it predictable
on a technical level the nostril picker is awful
bland and inappropriate music
forgettable location
poorly edited
some of the worst acting i have sat through and very unimpressive special effect
even at 76 odd minute the nostril picker is far to long and really boring to sit through .
long about how bad the nostril picker is ,
unique in it is awfulness and incompetence .
that it is still not the worst film i
definitely one to avoid .
where he received notice.personally my favorite in this film
panic in the street won an oscar for best original screenplay
when they really should in their own best interest .
you will love this version.the plot of the classic opera is played out in the actual rehearsal of the opera by a flamenco troupe .
who has a bad case of writer 's block ,
for the greater part of the film
`` you did your best
each scene is utterly predictable
are funny
and the comedy scene were not so predictable
a beautiful movie ,
who had his own personal reason for hunting down brady.a hauntingly beautiful film .
riget is wonderful .
of telling the story together with good music and great actor .
but unfortunately there is no 'the end ' .
mayble little bit stupid
great director finishes his trilogy after 10 year using puppet animation .
the best animated film ever made .
the music is wonderful
is perhaps one of my favorite song from any movie musical i
i mean a `` ha ha '' funny joke .
because the only redeeming thing
inane plot and horrible acting .
beach and movie are my greatest passion ;
therefore i loved this little gem about a group of girl and their passion for soccer .
this film is awful .
the screenplay is bad ,
the is script mediocre ,
which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film .
the acting was great ,
and there were some really great actor in it like
i recommend this movie and call it beautiful and delightful admitting
it is not perfect
they are having fun
and the beautiful paz vega
she was great in `` spanglish '' )
which are always fun on film ; a good story and a good scam .
this must be one of the worst movie
i was actually expecting a bad movie
all clich\u00e9e are included.the dialogue is so poorly written
was the best part for me !
with terrible writing
a great cast support stewart here
the comment made about the movie.as i read the awful opinion about the movie i actually wondered
the actress and director did a fantastic job in the movie.i had not had the pleasure
like it was the actress choice and her stupid choice .
opinion are what the are and its too bad
that all played great roles.busy philipps will be the highest paid actress someday
and i will probably not go back to it a second time.4/10
10/10 from an academic standpoint .
it was really beautiful seeing the fleeing woman running around on the screen from left to right and look around ,
was clearly devoted to showing the beautiful damsel in distress in various sexy way
but i had also enjoyed this animation as a child
as well.i give fire and ice 8/10 .
i especially enjoyed the built up to and the ending itself.its different
and make judgement then
who loved chris baldry the soldier ,
in the child 's perfectly maintained bedroom- with kitty too in the novel
it actually was not half bad .
not too bad.another movie
i see and hear funny little thing
that ever hit today 's music scene.unfortunately ,
to help him rekindle the flame of a dream long past.juliet gather up the bitter jimmy nail
who never let the flame burn out.as juliet search for the last member of their motley band ,
the spark fly as their memory flame forward ,
the pace of the movie is perfect and so much so
but still a great story ,
and despite the great acting
bland .
to make an awsome show.. but best of all ...
so beautiful ,
who wrote great story .
( with beautiful cinematography and photography ) ,
and acted amazingly by brannagh and cast
is the greatest movie ever made .
is truly amazing ... . awe inspiring .
it was an event.even more amazing ,
either drinking or making bad joke .
the music is just awful ,
the humor is not funny and all the female character slutty idiot or total geek .
as the relationship between blaise and garvin was certainly always one of the fascinating aspect of the novel and the long running comic strip .
the other problem is that the film is quite simply incredibly boring
but one of my go to hardcore horror reviewer really found it to be disappointing .
the script was also poor ... .they had line
with a horror movie and with below average actor ... .the result are incredibly pathetic .
the line and scenario were all very predictable .
it was awful .
he was great.the movie is about 5 stupid dumbsh ! t tourist
but watching someone with a bad
case of diarrhea is probably more fun and intense to watch .
the movie was incredibly disappointing .
even after this disappointment i am willing to give ryan another shot .
because this was bad news .
it is the kind of `` semi-perfect english ''
and is perhaps the best actress of the lot ,
i am a great fan of the batman comic and i became disappointed
and i was very disappointed.first of all ,
the animation is very poor .
it looks like a cheap
just about every modern-day cartoon is like that.the character design are even worse .
( which is funny
.the worst character design is that of the joker .
because his crime are so stupid and pointless .
batman is a fascinating and complex character
to find out their weak point like a detective would ,
but pointless fighting.what i hate
and turned them into stereotypical evil bad guy .
have an actual motive for their crime.the worst characterization is that of mr. freeze .
great origin .
the superb christopher nolan batman film .
it is that it lacks any sort of depth
this would be a great horror movie .
this is not the worst movie i have ever seen ,
poor audio quality
poor acting
and poor shot arrangement are some of the area
to make fun of ,
the best scene in the whole movie is when the lab team makes the gorilla visible again .
great special effect .
a really lame dirty joke and enough out of place swearing
why the reviews of this film are so universally bad ,
this dolph lundgren vehicle is a fun die hard throwback action flick ,
sure the script is not going to win any oscar its good fun
and the rest of the cast are not the best actor
all in all detention is an enjoyable action flick ,
my all-time favorite movie .
the screenplay is perfect ,
it is josie lawrence 's best work by far ,
this is quite simply the best most comprehensive documentary series
unfortunately
the performance of amanda peet and the rest of the cast were all rock solid ,
and really enjoyed .
timothy busfield 's character is without redeeming quality
this is a wonderful film
highly recommended .
drama to make me cry and one of the greatest dance scene to rival breakin 2 :
my grandmother loved it sooo much
i also enjoyed the music from the movie as well ,
the season finale sent mix message ,
the animation is superb ,
but it is an enjoyable thriller in a gangter genre
and if there are no sequel a great film in its own right .
but only with the help of the police this will come true ... a bloody 65-minute mess ... horny zombie
i have seen worst horror-flick ,
but this one was pretty bad too .
so i was disappointed
and shape it into something enjoyable .
as well.davis is complemented by a great story
great jan adele .
amazingly
what a waste of time .
a piece of unfunny garbage .
only giving it 3/10
gets `` great performance '' out of a ton of ham in their debut .
it was just annoying .
i was seriously much more entertained by cleaning my finger nail than watching this mess .
it is fun seeing forsythe in a rare clean-cut hero role
beautiful exotic setting is quite a nice backdrop .
because of how poorly it was created ,
this movie is just truly awful
but trying to ram every issue into such a poorly
conceived film does little justice to any of these causes.the script is poor
to become a fully functioning one ,
( there is even a great bit midway through where ,
holds up beautifully as an artistic experiment in testing the water of what could be done in swedish cinema ,
this gem for gore lover is extremely underrated .
it is pure delight and fun !
the story is weak
beautifully realized and \u0096 surprise \u0096 pretty damn accurate !
flavium is a beautiful 14th century adolescent ,
its very funny and very dry .
very funny .
both left a bad taste in my mouth .
-- some of the acting is truly epically bad
i also did not like how the daughter 's relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of her family 's perversion or predilection for bestiality .
a lush fantasy world with quirky character and annoying 80 's music .
us british have actually made a great motorcycle film
this is up there with the best of british comedy .
this is phil daniel best screen performance ,
i loved gary stretch in shane meadow ' fantastic dead man shoe and here
( even my girlfriend loved it ) .
and have one of the best night in the cinema
this ranks as one of the worst movie i have seen in year .
the make up is so bad
the ending is a massive disappointment - along the line of `` and then
do not waste your time or your money .
the acting is horrible
the concept is great :
the movie has nearly no funny scene .
that wrote the new law for fun ,
that this was how person talked in general danish society.3/10 .
this is one of the worst movie i have seen this year .
bad drag .
now its all regurgitated spin-off with predictable character and plots.thankfully ,
a great film
were nominated for best picture that year
and this was ignored completely except for one nomination for best screenplay .
that i really enjoyed this film ,
she was funny
it has to be one of the weakest plot i
it borders on the ink of tedious .
the absence of violence and sex was refreshing .
it was one of the worst
most poorly executed
and poorly acted movie i have ever seen .
the worst part was that
it was not even bad in a good
just plain terrible - i could not figure out why they even bothered to show it on hbo .
belushi was ridiculously silly - very unbelievable as an `` eccentric '' hit man .
it is fascinating to see how a movie can go wrong
and what makes it bad .
die by the sword ... '' ridiculous .
it was awful !
how it was going to end especially with all the shot of the chef 's wife and the rape of the first girl.the worst part was the qanda with the director/writer and writer/producer
and do drugs.do not waste your time .
but what makes it really bad
but her performance in this movie is bad.her delivery is robotic .
but the end was disappointing as well .
it has great graphic
one of my all time favorite game
that do not match the message of the movie .
the funniest is
that the director has chosen to make the film with bad camera angle .
but i have never heard of hunting with poor camera angle ;
and it is not truly a horrible movie ,
that were a little mediocre and confusing ,
that the entire movie was horrible .
out.the actor did a great job ,
what a disappointment .
the plot lacks considerably :
that is fantastic !
just for fun .
it turns into a pathos-laden mess
with occasional `` funny '' bit interjected
leslie ann warren is nothing short of wasted .
the worst part is this movie 's musical number ,
they did not care very much.the greatest cartoon was rocko 's modern life
streisand 's beautiful rendition of the oscar winning song 'evergreen ' .
i enjoyed watching cliffhanger
unfortunately there is a bit too much story
unfortunately
it is refreshing
unfortunately
in my mind the best of the ealing comedy and one of my favourite film of all time .
i am always astonished by the wonderful direction in these film as well .
alec guinness gives a fantastically understated performance
such an insular character could quickly have become boring or irritating
with a great plot
great cast
